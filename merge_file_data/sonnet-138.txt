                               SONNET CXXXVIII

                When my love swears that she is made of truth
                  I do believe her, though I know she lies,
                That she might think me some untutor'd youth,
                 Unlearned in the world's false subtleties.
              Thus vainly thinking that she thinks me young, 5
                Although she knows my days are past the best,
                 Simply I credit her false speaking tongue:
               On both sides thus is simple truth suppress'd.
                  But wherefore says she not she is unjust?
                  And wherefore say not I that I am old? 10
                  O, love's best habit is in seeming trust,
                And age in love loves not to have years told:
                    Therefore I lie with her and she with me,
                  And in our faults by lies we flatter'd be. 14
