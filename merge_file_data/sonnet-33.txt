                                SONNET XXXIII

                  Full many a glorious morning have I seen
                Flatter the mountain-tops with sovereign eye,
                 Kissing with golden face the meadows green,
                 Gilding pale streams with heavenly alchemy;
                   Anon permit the basest clouds to ride 5
                    With ugly rack on his celestial face,
                 And from the forlorn world his visage hide,
                 Stealing unseen to west with this disgrace:
                   Even so my sun one early morn did shine
                 With all triumphant splendor on my brow; 10
                  But out, alack! he was but one hour mine;
                The region cloud hath mask'd him from me now.
                  Yet him for this my love no whit disdaineth;
           Suns of the world may stain when heaven's sun staineth. 14
