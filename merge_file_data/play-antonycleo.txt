   Act I, Scene 1

   Alexandria. A room in CLEOPATRA’s palace.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   [Enter DEMETRIUS and PHILO]
     * Philo. Nay, but this dotage of our general's
       O'erflows the measure: those his goodly eyes,
       That o'er the files and musters of the war
       Have glow'd like plated Mars, now bend, now turn, 5
       The office and devotion of their view
       Upon a tawny front: his captain's heart,
       Which in the scuffles of great fights hath burst
       The buckles on his breast, reneges all temper,
       And is become the bellows and the fan 10
       To cool a gipsy's lust.
       [Flourish. Enter ANTONY, CLEOPATRA, her Ladies,]
       the Train, with Eunuchs fanning her]
       Look, where they come:
       Take but good note, and you shall see in him. 15
       The triple pillar of the world transform'd
       Into a strumpet's fool: behold and see.

     * Cleopatra. If it be love indeed, tell me how much.

     * Antony. There's beggary in the love that can be reckon'd.

     * Cleopatra. I'll set a bourn how far to be beloved. 20

     * Antony. Then must thou needs find out new heaven, new earth.

   [Enter an Attendant]
     * Attendant. News, my good lord, from Rome.

     * Antony. Grates me: the sum.

     * Cleopatra. Nay, hear them, Antony: 25
       Fulvia perchance is angry; or, who knows
       If the scarce-bearded Caesar have not sent
       His powerful mandate to you, 'Do this, or this;
       Take in that kingdom, and enfranchise that;
       Perform 't, or else we damn thee.' 30

     * Antony. How, my love!

     * Cleopatra. Perchance! nay, and most like:
       You must not stay here longer, your dismission
       Is come from Caesar; therefore hear it, Antony.
       Where's Fulvia's process? Caesar's I would say? both? 35
       Call in the messengers. As I am Egypt's queen,
       Thou blushest, Antony; and that blood of thine
       Is Caesar's homager: else so thy cheek pays shame
       When shrill-tongued Fulvia scolds. The messengers!

     * Antony. Let Rome in Tiber melt, and the wide arch 40
       Of the ranged empire fall! Here is my space.
       Kingdoms are clay: our dungy earth alike
       Feeds beast as man: the nobleness of life
       Is to do thus; when such a mutual pair
       [Embracing] 45
       And such a twain can do't, in which I bind,
       On pain of punishment, the world to weet
       We stand up peerless.

     * Cleopatra. Excellent falsehood!
       Why did he marry Fulvia, and not love her? 50
       I'll seem the fool I am not; Antony
       Will be himself.

     * Antony. But stirr'd by Cleopatra.
       Now, for the love of Love and her soft hours,
       Let's not confound the time with conference harsh: 55
       There's not a minute of our lives should stretch
       Without some pleasure now. What sport tonight?

     * Cleopatra. Hear the ambassadors.

     * Antony. Fie, wrangling queen!
       Whom every thing becomes, to chide, to laugh, 60
       To weep; whose every passion fully strives
       To make itself, in thee, fair and admired!
       No messenger, but thine; and all alone
       To-night we'll wander through the streets and note
       The qualities of people. Come, my queen; 65
       Last night you did desire it: speak not to us.
       [Exeunt MARK ANTONY and CLEOPATRA with]
       their train]

     * Demetrius. Is Caesar with Antonius prized so slight?

     * Philo. Sir, sometimes, when he is not Antony, 70
       He comes too short of that great property
       Which still should go with Antony.

     * Demetrius. I am full sorry
       That he approves the common liar, who
       Thus speaks of him at Rome: but I will hope 75
       Of better deeds to-morrow. Rest you happy!

   [Exeunt]

   Act I, Scene 2

   The same. Another room.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   [Enter CHARMIAN, IRAS, ALEXAS, and a Soothsayer]
     * Charmian. Lord Alexas, sweet Alexas, most any thing Alexas,
       almost most absolute Alexas, where's the soothsayer 80
       that you praised so to the queen? O, that I knew
       this husband, which, you say, must charge his horns
       with garlands!

     * Alexas. Soothsayer!

     * Soothsayer. Your will? 85

     * Charmian. Is this the man? Is't you, sir, that know things?

     * Soothsayer. In nature's infinite book of secrecy
       A little I can read.

     * Alexas. Show him your hand.

   [Enter DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS]
     * Domitius Enobarus. Bring in the banquet quickly; wine enough
       Cleopatra's health to drink.

     * Charmian. Good sir, give me good fortune.

     * Soothsayer. I make not, but foresee.

     * Charmian. Pray, then, foresee me one. 95

     * Soothsayer. You shall be yet far fairer than you are.

     * Charmian. He means in flesh.

     * Iras. No, you shall paint when you are old.

     * Charmian. Wrinkles forbid!

     * Alexas. Vex not his prescience; be attentive. 100

     * Charmian. Hush!

     * Soothsayer. You shall be more beloving than beloved.

     * Charmian. I had rather heat my liver with drinking.

     * Alexas. Nay, hear him.

     * Charmian. Good now, some excellent fortune! Let me be married 105
       to three kings in a forenoon, and widow them all:
       let me have a child at fifty, to whom Herod of Jewry
       may do homage: find me to marry me with Octavius
       Caesar, and companion me with my mistress.

     * Soothsayer. You shall outlive the lady whom you serve. 110

     * Charmian. O excellent! I love long life better than figs.

     * Soothsayer. You have seen and proved a fairer former fortune
       Than that which is to approach.

     * Charmian. Then belike my children shall have no names:
       prithee, how many boys and wenches must I have? 115

     * Soothsayer. If every of your wishes had a womb.
       And fertile every wish, a million.

     * Charmian. Out, fool! I forgive thee for a witch.

     * Alexas. You think none but your sheets are privy to your wishes.

     * Charmian. Nay, come, tell Iras hers. 120

     * Alexas. We'll know all our fortunes.

     * Domitius Enobarus. Mine, and most of our fortunes, to-night, shall
       be—drunk to bed.

     * Iras. There's a palm presages chastity, if nothing else.

     * Charmian. E'en as the o'erflowing Nilus presageth famine. 125

     * Iras. Go, you wild bedfellow, you cannot soothsay.

     * Charmian. Nay, if an oily palm be not a fruitful
       prognostication, I cannot scratch mine ear. Prithee,
       tell her but a worky-day fortune.

     * Soothsayer. Your fortunes are alike. 130

     * Iras. But how, but how? give me particulars.

     * Soothsayer. I have said.

     * Iras. Am I not an inch of fortune better than she?

     * Charmian. Well, if you were but an inch of fortune better than
       I, where would you choose it? 135

     * Iras. Not in my husband's nose.

     * Charmian. Our worser thoughts heavens mend! Alexas,—come,
       his fortune, his fortune! O, let him marry a woman
       that cannot go, sweet Isis, I beseech thee! and let
       her die too, and give him a worse! and let worst 140
       follow worse, till the worst of all follow him
       laughing to his grave, fifty-fold a cuckold! Good
       Isis, hear me this prayer, though thou deny me a
       matter of more weight; good Isis, I beseech thee!

     * Iras. Amen. Dear goddess, hear that prayer of the people! 145
       for, as it is a heartbreaking to see a handsome man
       loose-wived, so it is a deadly sorrow to behold a
       foul knave uncuckolded: therefore, dear Isis, keep
       decorum, and fortune him accordingly!

     * Charmian. Amen. 150

     * Alexas. Lo, now, if it lay in their hands to make me a
       cuckold, they would make themselves whores, but
       they'ld do't!

     * Domitius Enobarus. Hush! here comes Antony.

     * Charmian. Not he; the queen. 155

   [Enter CLEOPATRA]
     * Cleopatra. Saw you my lord?

     * Domitius Enobarus. No, lady.

     * Cleopatra. Was he not here?

     * Charmian. No, madam. 160

     * Cleopatra. He was disposed to mirth; but on the sudden
       A Roman thought hath struck him. Enobarbus!

     * Domitius Enobarus. Madam?

     * Cleopatra. Seek him, and bring him hither.
       Where's Alexas? 165

     * Alexas. Here, at your service. My lord approaches.

     * Cleopatra. We will not look upon him: go with us.

   [Exeunt]

   [Enter MARK ANTONY with a Messenger and Attendants]
     * Messenger. Fulvia thy wife first came into the field. 170

     * Antony. Against my brother Lucius?

     * Messenger. Ay:
       But soon that war had end, and the time's state
       Made friends of them, joining their force 'gainst Caesar;
       Whose better issue in the war, from Italy, 175
       Upon the first encounter, drave them.

     * Antony. Well, what worst?

     * Messenger. The nature of bad news infects the teller.

     * Antony. When it concerns the fool or coward. On:
       Things that are past are done with me. 'Tis thus: 180
       Who tells me true, though in his tale lie death,
       I hear him as he flatter'd.

     * Messenger. Labienus—
       This is stiff news—hath, with his Parthian force,
       Extended Asia from Euphrates; 185
       His conquering banner shook from Syria
       To Lydia and to Ionia; Whilst—

     * Antony. Antony, thou wouldst say,—

     * Messenger. O, my lord!

     * Antony. Speak to me home, mince not the general tongue: 190
       Name Cleopatra as she is call'd in Rome;
       Rail thou in Fulvia's phrase; and taunt my faults
       With such full licence as both truth and malice
       Have power to utter. O, then we bring forth weeds,
       When our quick minds lie still; and our ills told us 195
       Is as our earing. Fare thee well awhile.

     * Messenger. At your noble pleasure.

   [Exit]
     * Antony. From Sicyon, ho, the news! Speak there!

     * First Attendant. The man from Sicyon,—is there such an one? 200

     * Second Attendant. He stays upon your will.

     * Antony. Let him appear.
       These strong Egyptian fetters I must break,
       Or lose myself in dotage.
       [Enter another Messenger] 205
       What are you?

     * Second Messenger. Fulvia thy wife is dead.

     * Antony. Where died she?

     * Second Messenger. In Sicyon:
       Her length of sickness, with what else more serious 210
       Importeth thee to know, this bears.

   [Gives a letter]
     * Antony. Forbear me.
       [Exit Second Messenger]
       There's a great spirit gone! Thus did I desire it: 215
       What our contempt doth often hurl from us,
       We wish it ours again; the present pleasure,
       By revolution lowering, does become
       The opposite of itself: she's good, being gone;
       The hand could pluck her back that shoved her on. 220
       I must from this enchanting queen break off:
       Ten thousand harms, more than the ills I know,
       My idleness doth hatch. How now! Enobarbus!

   [Re-enter DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS]
     * Domitius Enobarus. What's your pleasure, sir? 225

     * Antony. I must with haste from hence.

     * Domitius Enobarus. Why, then, we kill all our women:
       we see how mortal an unkindness is to them;
       if they suffer our departure, death's the word.

     * Antony. I must be gone. 230

     * Domitius Enobarus. Under a compelling occasion, let women die; it
       were
       pity to cast them away for nothing; though, between
       them and a great cause, they should be esteemed
       nothing. Cleopatra, catching but the least noise of
       this, dies instantly; I have seen her die twenty 235
       times upon far poorer moment: I do think there is
       mettle in death, which commits some loving act upon
       her, she hath such a celerity in dying.

     * Antony. She is cunning past man's thought.

   [Exit ALEXAS]
     * Domitius Enobarus. Alack, sir, no; her passions are made of nothing
       but
       the finest part of pure love: we cannot call her
       winds and waters sighs and tears; they are greater
       storms and tempests than almanacs can report: this
       cannot be cunning in her; if it be, she makes a 245
       shower of rain as well as Jove.

     * Antony. Would I had never seen her.

     * Domitius Enobarus. O, sir, you had then left unseen a wonderful
       piece
       of work; which not to have been blest withal would
       have discredited your travel. 250

     * Antony. Fulvia is dead.

     * Domitius Enobarus. Sir?

     * Antony. Fulvia is dead.

     * Domitius Enobarus. Fulvia!

     * Antony. Dead. 255

     * Domitius Enobarus. Why, sir, give the gods a thankful sacrifice.
       When
       it pleaseth their deities to take the wife of a man
       from him, it shows to man the tailors of the earth;
       comforting therein, that when old robes are worn
       out, there are members to make new. If there were 260
       no more women but Fulvia, then had you indeed a cut,
       and the case to be lamented: this grief is crowned
       with consolation; your old smock brings forth a new
       petticoat: and indeed the tears live in an onion
       that should water this sorrow. 265

     * Antony. The business she hath broached in the state
       Cannot endure my absence.

     * Domitius Enobarus. And the business you have broached here cannot
       be
       without you; especially that of Cleopatra's, which
       wholly depends on your abode. 270

     * Antony. No more light answers. Let our officers
       Have notice what we purpose. I shall break
       The cause of our expedience to the queen,
       And get her leave to part. For not alone
       The death of Fulvia, with more urgent touches, 275
       Do strongly speak to us; but the letters too
       Of many our contriving friends in Rome
       Petition us at home: Sextus Pompeius
       Hath given the dare to Caesar, and commands
       The empire of the sea: our slippery people, 280
       Whose love is never link'd to the deserver
       Till his deserts are past, begin to throw
       Pompey the Great and all his dignities
       Upon his son; who, high in name and power,
       Higher than both in blood and life, stands up 285
       For the main soldier: whose quality, going on,
       The sides o' the world may danger: much is breeding,
       Which, like the courser's hair, hath yet but life,
       And not a serpent's poison. Say, our pleasure,
       To such whose place is under us, requires 290
       Our quick remove from hence.

     * Domitius Enobarus. I shall do't.

   [Exeunt]

   [Enter CLEOPATRA, CHARMIAN, IRAS, and ALEXAS]
     * Cleopatra. Where is he? 295

     * Charmian. I did not see him since.

     * Cleopatra. See where he is, who's with him, what he does:
       I did not send you: if you find him sad,
       Say I am dancing; if in mirth, report
       That I am sudden sick: quick, and return. 300

   [Exit ALEXAS]
     * Charmian. Madam, methinks, if you did love him dearly,
       You do not hold the method to enforce
       The like from him.

     * Cleopatra. What should I do, I do not? 305

     * Charmian. In each thing give him way, cross him nothing.

     * Cleopatra. Thou teachest like a fool; the way to lose him.

     * Charmian. Tempt him not so too far; I wish, forbear:
       In time we hate that which we often fear.
       But here comes Antony. 310

   [Enter MARK ANTONY]
     * Cleopatra. I am sick and sullen.

     * Antony. I am sorry to give breathing to my purpose,—

     * Cleopatra. Help me away, dear Charmian; I shall fall:
       It cannot be thus long, the sides of nature 315
       Will not sustain it.

     * Antony. Now, my dearest queen,—

     * Cleopatra. Pray you, stand further from me.

     * Antony. What's the matter?

     * Cleopatra. I know, by that same eye, there's some good news. 320
       What says the married woman? You may go:
       Would she had never given you leave to come!
       Let her not say 'tis I that keep you here:
       I have no power upon you; hers you are.

     * Antony. The gods best know,— 325

     * Cleopatra. O, never was there queen
       So mightily betray'd! yet at the first
       I saw the treasons planted.

     * Antony. Cleopatra,—

     * Cleopatra. Why should I think you can be mine and true, 330
       Though you in swearing shake the throned gods,
       Who have been false to Fulvia? Riotous madness,
       To be entangled with those mouth-made vows,
       Which break themselves in swearing!

     * Antony. Most sweet queen,— 335

     * Cleopatra. Nay, pray you, seek no colour for your going,
       But bid farewell, and go: when you sued staying,
       Then was the time for words: no going then;
       Eternity was in our lips and eyes,
       Bliss in our brows' bent; none our parts so poor, 340
       But was a race of heaven: they are so still,
       Or thou, the greatest soldier of the world,
       Art turn'd the greatest liar.

     * Antony. How now, lady!

     * Cleopatra. I would I had thy inches; thou shouldst know 345
       There were a heart in Egypt.

     * Antony. Hear me, queen:
       The strong necessity of time commands
       Our services awhile; but my full heart
       Remains in use with you. Our Italy 350
       Shines o'er with civil swords: Sextus Pompeius
       Makes his approaches to the port of Rome:
       Equality of two domestic powers
       Breed scrupulous faction: the hated, grown to strength,
       Are newly grown to love: the condemn'd Pompey, 355
       Rich in his father's honour, creeps apace,
       Into the hearts of such as have not thrived
       Upon the present state, whose numbers threaten;
       And quietness, grown sick of rest, would purge
       By any desperate change: my more particular, 360
       And that which most with you should safe my going,
       Is Fulvia's death.

     * Cleopatra. Though age from folly could not give me freedom,
       It does from childishness: can Fulvia die?

     * Antony. She's dead, my queen: 365
       Look here, and at thy sovereign leisure read
       The garboils she awaked; at the last, best:
       See when and where she died.

     * Cleopatra. O most false love!
       Where be the sacred vials thou shouldst fill 370
       With sorrowful water? Now I see, I see,
       In Fulvia's death, how mine received shall be.

     * Antony. Quarrel no more, but be prepared to know
       The purposes I bear; which are, or cease,
       As you shall give the advice. By the fire 375
       That quickens Nilus' slime, I go from hence
       Thy soldier, servant; making peace or war
       As thou affect'st.

     * Cleopatra. Cut my lace, Charmian, come;
       But let it be: I am quickly ill, and well, 380
       So Antony loves.

     * Antony. My precious queen, forbear;
       And give true evidence to his love, which stands
       An honourable trial.

     * Cleopatra. So Fulvia told me. 385
       I prithee, turn aside and weep for her,
       Then bid adieu to me, and say the tears
       Belong to Egypt: good now, play one scene
       Of excellent dissembling; and let it look
       Life perfect honour. 390

     * Antony. You'll heat my blood: no more.

     * Cleopatra. You can do better yet; but this is meetly.

     * Antony. Now, by my sword,—

     * Cleopatra. And target. Still he mends;
       But this is not the best. Look, prithee, Charmian, 395
       How this Herculean Roman does become
       The carriage of his chafe.

     * Antony. I'll leave you, lady.

     * Cleopatra. Courteous lord, one word.
       Sir, you and I must part, but that's not it: 400
       Sir, you and I have loved, but there's not it;
       That you know well: something it is I would,
       O, my oblivion is a very Antony,
       And I am all forgotten.

     * Antony. But that your royalty 405
       Holds idleness your subject, I should take you
       For idleness itself.

     * Cleopatra. 'Tis sweating labour
       To bear such idleness so near the heart
       As Cleopatra this. But, sir, forgive me; 410
       Since my becomings kill me, when they do not
       Eye well to you: your honour calls you hence;
       Therefore be deaf to my unpitied folly.
       And all the gods go with you! upon your sword
       Sit laurel victory! and smooth success 415
       Be strew'd before your feet!

     * Antony. Let us go. Come;
       Our separation so abides, and flies,
       That thou, residing here, go'st yet with me,
       And I, hence fleeting, here remain with thee. Away! 420

   [Exeunt]

   Act I, Scene 4

   Rome. OCTAVIUS CAESAR’s house.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   [Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR, reading a letter, LEPIDUS,] [p]and their Train]
     * Octavius. You may see, Lepidus, and henceforth know,
       It is not Caesar's natural vice to hate 425
       Our great competitor: from Alexandria
       This is the news: he fishes, drinks, and wastes
       The lamps of night in revel; is not more man-like
       Than Cleopatra; nor the queen of Ptolemy
       More womanly than he; hardly gave audience, or 430
       Vouchsafed to think he had partners: you shall find there
       A man who is the abstract of all faults
       That all men follow.

     * Lepidus. I must not think there are
       Evils enow to darken all his goodness: 435
       His faults in him seem as the spots of heaven,
       More fiery by night's blackness; hereditary,
       Rather than purchased; what he cannot change,
       Than what he chooses.

     * Octavius. You are too indulgent. Let us grant, it is not 440
       Amiss to tumble on the bed of Ptolemy;
       To give a kingdom for a mirth; to sit
       And keep the turn of tippling with a slave;
       To reel the streets at noon, and stand the buffet
       With knaves that smell of sweat: say this 445
       becomes him,—
       As his composure must be rare indeed
       Whom these things cannot blemish,—yet must Antony
       No way excuse his soils, when we do bear
       So great weight in his lightness. If he fill'd 450
       His vacancy with his voluptuousness,
       Full surfeits, and the dryness of his bones,
       Call on him for't: but to confound such time,
       That drums him from his sport, and speaks as loud
       As his own state and ours,—'tis to be chid 455
       As we rate boys, who, being mature in knowledge,
       Pawn their experience to their present pleasure,
       And so rebel to judgment.

   [Enter a Messenger]
     * Lepidus. Here's more news. 460

     * Messenger. Thy biddings have been done; and every hour,
       Most noble Caesar, shalt thou have report
       How 'tis abroad. Pompey is strong at sea;
       And it appears he is beloved of those
       That only have fear'd Caesar: to the ports 465
       The discontents repair, and men's reports
       Give him much wrong'd.

     * Octavius. I should have known no less.
       It hath been taught us from the primal state,
       That he which is was wish'd until he were; 470
       And the ebb'd man, ne'er loved till ne'er worth love,
       Comes dear'd by being lack'd. This common body,
       Like to a vagabond flag upon the stream,
       Goes to and back, lackeying the varying tide,
       To rot itself with motion. 475

     * Messenger. Caesar, I bring thee word,
       Menecrates and Menas, famous pirates,
       Make the sea serve them, which they ear and wound
       With keels of every kind: many hot inroads
       They make in Italy; the borders maritime 480
       Lack blood to think on't, and flush youth revolt:
       No vessel can peep forth, but 'tis as soon
       Taken as seen; for Pompey's name strikes more
       Than could his war resisted.

     * Octavius. Antony, 485
       Leave thy lascivious wassails. When thou once
       Wast beaten from Modena, where thou slew'st
       Hirtius and Pansa, consuls, at thy heel
       Did famine follow; whom thou fought'st against,
       Though daintily brought up, with patience more 490
       Than savages could suffer: thou didst drink
       The stale of horses, and the gilded puddle
       Which beasts would cough at: thy palate then did deign
       The roughest berry on the rudest hedge;
       Yea, like the stag, when snow the pasture sheets, 495
       The barks of trees thou browsed'st; on the Alps
       It is reported thou didst eat strange flesh,
       Which some did die to look on: and all this—
       It wounds thine honour that I speak it now—
       Was borne so like a soldier, that thy cheek 500
       So much as lank'd not.

     * Lepidus. 'Tis pity of him.

     * Octavius. Let his shames quickly
       Drive him to Rome: 'tis time we twain
       Did show ourselves i' the field; and to that end 505
       Assemble we immediate council: Pompey
       Thrives in our idleness.

     * Lepidus. To-morrow, Caesar,
       I shall be furnish'd to inform you rightly
       Both what by sea and land I can be able 510
       To front this present time.

     * Octavius. Till which encounter,
       It is my business too. Farewell.

     * Lepidus. Farewell, my lord: what you shall know meantime
       Of stirs abroad, I shall beseech you, sir, 515
       To let me be partaker.

     * Octavius. Doubt not, sir;
       I knew it for my bond.

   [Exeunt]

   Act I, Scene 5

   Alexandria. CLEOPATRA’s palace.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   [Enter CLEOPATRA, CHARMIAN, IRAS, and MARDIAN]
     * Cleopatra. Charmian!

     * Charmian. Madam?

     * Cleopatra. Ha, ha!
       Give me to drink mandragora.

     * Charmian. Why, madam? 525

     * Cleopatra. That I might sleep out this great gap of time
       My Antony is away.

     * Charmian. You think of him too much.

     * Cleopatra. O, 'tis treason!

     * Charmian. Madam, I trust, not so. 530

     * Cleopatra. Thou, eunuch Mardian!

     * Mardian. What's your highness' pleasure?

     * Cleopatra. Not now to hear thee sing; I take no pleasure
       In aught an eunuch has: 'tis well for thee,
       That, being unseminar'd, thy freer thoughts 535
       May not fly forth of Egypt. Hast thou affections?

     * Mardian. Yes, gracious madam.

     * Cleopatra. Indeed!

     * Mardian. Not in deed, madam; for I can do nothing
       But what indeed is honest to be done: 540
       Yet have I fierce affections, and think
       What Venus did with Mars.

     * Cleopatra. O Charmian,
       Where think'st thou he is now? Stands he, or sits he?
       Or does he walk? or is he on his horse? 545
       O happy horse, to bear the weight of Antony!
       Do bravely, horse! for wot'st thou whom thou movest?
       The demi-Atlas of this earth, the arm
       And burgonet of men. He's speaking now,
       Or murmuring 'Where's my serpent of old Nile?' 550
       For so he calls me: now I feed myself
       With most delicious poison. Think on me,
       That am with Phoebus' amorous pinches black,
       And wrinkled deep in time? Broad-fronted Caesar,
       When thou wast here above the ground, I was 555
       A morsel for a monarch: and great Pompey
       Would stand and make his eyes grow in my brow;
       There would he anchor his aspect and die
       With looking on his life.

   [Enter ALEXAS, from OCTAVIUS CAESAR]
     * Alexas. Sovereign of Egypt, hail!

     * Cleopatra. How much unlike art thou Mark Antony!
       Yet, coming from him, that great medicine hath
       With his tinct gilded thee.
       How goes it with my brave Mark Antony? 565

     * Alexas. Last thing he did, dear queen,
       He kiss'd,—the last of many doubled kisses,—
       This orient pearl. His speech sticks in my heart.

     * Cleopatra. Mine ear must pluck it thence.

     * Alexas. 'Good friend,' quoth he, 570
       'Say, the firm Roman to great Egypt sends
       This treasure of an oyster; at whose foot,
       To mend the petty present, I will piece
       Her opulent throne with kingdoms; all the east,
       Say thou, shall call her mistress.' So he nodded, 575
       And soberly did mount an arm-gaunt steed,
       Who neigh'd so high, that what I would have spoke
       Was beastly dumb'd by him.

     * Cleopatra. What, was he sad or merry?

     * Alexas. Like to the time o' the year between the extremes 580
       Of hot and cold, he was nor sad nor merry.

     * Cleopatra. O well-divided disposition! Note him,
       Note him good Charmian, 'tis the man; but note him:
       He was not sad, for he would shine on those
       That make their looks by his; he was not merry, 585
       Which seem'd to tell them his remembrance lay
       In Egypt with his joy; but between both:
       O heavenly mingle! Be'st thou sad or merry,
       The violence of either thee becomes,
       So does it no man else. Met'st thou my posts? 590

     * Alexas. Ay, madam, twenty several messengers:
       Why do you send so thick?

     * Cleopatra. Who's born that day
       When I forget to send to Antony,
       Shall die a beggar. Ink and paper, Charmian. 595
       Welcome, my good Alexas. Did I, Charmian,
       Ever love Caesar so?

     * Charmian. O that brave Caesar!

     * Cleopatra. Be choked with such another emphasis!
       Say, the brave Antony. 600

     * Charmian. The valiant Caesar!

     * Cleopatra. By Isis, I will give thee bloody teeth,
       If thou with Caesar paragon again
       My man of men.

     * Charmian. By your most gracious pardon, 605
       I sing but after you.

     * Cleopatra. My salad days,
       When I was green in judgment: cold in blood,
       To say as I said then! But, come, away;
       Get me ink and paper: 610
       He shall have every day a several greeting,
       Or I'll unpeople Egypt.

   Act II, Scene 1

   Messina. POMPEY’s house.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   [Enter POMPEY, MENECRATES, and MENAS, in] [p]warlike manner]
     * Pompey. If the great gods be just, they shall assist
       The deeds of justest men.

     * Menecrates. Know, worthy Pompey,
       That what they do delay, they not deny.

     * Pompey. Whiles we are suitors to their throne, decays 620
       The thing we sue for.

     * Menecrates. We, ignorant of ourselves,
       Beg often our own harms, which the wise powers
       Deny us for our good; so find we profit
       By losing of our prayers. 625

     * Pompey. I shall do well:
       The people love me, and the sea is mine;
       My powers are crescent, and my auguring hope
       Says it will come to the full. Mark Antony
       In Egypt sits at dinner, and will make 630
       No wars without doors: Caesar gets money where
       He loses hearts: Lepidus flatters both,
       Of both is flatter'd; but he neither loves,
       Nor either cares for him.

     * Menas. Caesar and Lepidus 635
       Are in the field: a mighty strength they carry.

     * Pompey. Where have you this? 'tis false.

     * Menas. From Silvius, sir.

     * Pompey. He dreams: I know they are in Rome together,
       Looking for Antony. But all the charms of love, 640
       Salt Cleopatra, soften thy waned lip!
       Let witchcraft join with beauty, lust with both!
       Tie up the libertine in a field of feasts,
       Keep his brain fuming; Epicurean cooks
       Sharpen with cloyless sauce his appetite; 645
       That sleep and feeding may prorogue his honour
       Even till a Lethe'd dulness!
       [Enter VARRIUS]
       How now, Varrius!

     * Varrius. This is most certain that I shall deliver: 650
       Mark Antony is every hour in Rome
       Expected: since he went from Egypt 'tis
       A space for further travel.

     * Pompey. I could have given less matter
       A better ear. Menas, I did not think 655
       This amorous surfeiter would have donn'd his helm
       For such a petty war: his soldiership
       Is twice the other twain: but let us rear
       The higher our opinion, that our stirring
       Can from the lap of Egypt's widow pluck 660
       The ne'er-lust-wearied Antony.

     * Menas. I cannot hope
       Caesar and Antony shall well greet together:
       His wife that's dead did trespasses to Caesar;
       His brother warr'd upon him; although, I think, 665
       Not moved by Antony.

     * Pompey. I know not, Menas,
       How lesser enmities may give way to greater.
       Were't not that we stand up against them all,
       'Twere pregnant they should square between 670
       themselves;
       For they have entertained cause enough
       To draw their swords: but how the fear of us
       May cement their divisions and bind up
       The petty difference, we yet not know. 675
       Be't as our gods will have't! It only stands
       Our lives upon to use our strongest hands.
       Come, Menas.

   [Exeunt]

   Act II, Scene 2

   Rome. The house of LEPIDUS.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   [Enter DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS and LEPIDUS]
     * Lepidus. Good Enobarbus, 'tis a worthy deed,
       And shall become you well, to entreat your captain
       To soft and gentle speech.

     * Domitius Enobarus. I shall entreat him
       To answer like himself: if Caesar move him, 685
       Let Antony look over Caesar's head
       And speak as loud as Mars. By Jupiter,
       Were I the wearer of Antonius' beard,
       I would not shave't to-day.

     * Lepidus. 'Tis not a time 690
       For private stomaching.

     * Domitius Enobarus. Every time
       Serves for the matter that is then born in't.

     * Lepidus. But small to greater matters must give way.

     * Domitius Enobarus. Not if the small come first. 695

     * Lepidus. Your speech is passion:
       But, pray you, stir no embers up. Here comes
       The noble Antony.

   [Enter MARK ANTONY and VENTIDIUS]
     * Domitius Enobarus. And yonder, Caesar. 700

   [Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR, MECAENAS, and AGRIPPA]
     * Antony. If we compose well here, to Parthia:
       Hark, Ventidius.

     * Octavius. I do not know,
       Mecaenas; ask Agrippa. 705

     * Lepidus. Noble friends,
       That which combined us was most great, and let not
       A leaner action rend us. What's amiss,
       May it be gently heard: when we debate
       Our trivial difference loud, we do commit 710
       Murder in healing wounds: then, noble partners,
       The rather, for I earnestly beseech,
       Touch you the sourest points with sweetest terms,
       Nor curstness grow to the matter.

     * Antony. 'Tis spoken well. 715
       Were we before our armies, and to fight.
       I should do thus.

   [Flourish]
     * Octavius. Welcome to Rome.

     * Antony. Thank you. 720

     * Octavius. Sit.

     * Antony. Sit, sir.

     * Octavius. Nay, then.

     * Antony. I learn, you take things ill which are not so,
       Or being, concern you not. 725

     * Octavius. I must be laugh'd at,
       If, or for nothing or a little, I
       Should say myself offended, and with you
       Chiefly i' the world; more laugh'd at, that I should
       Once name you derogately, when to sound your name 730
       It not concern'd me.

     * Antony. My being in Egypt, Caesar,
       What was't to you?

     * Octavius. No more than my residing here at Rome
       Might be to you in Egypt: yet, if you there 735
       Did practise on my state, your being in Egypt
       Might be my question.

     * Antony. How intend you, practised?

     * Octavius. You may be pleased to catch at mine intent
       By what did here befal me. Your wife and brother 740
       Made wars upon me; and their contestation
       Was theme for you, you were the word of war.

     * Antony. You do mistake your business; my brother never
       Did urge me in his act: I did inquire it;
       And have my learning from some true reports, 745
       That drew their swords with you. Did he not rather
       Discredit my authority with yours;
       And make the wars alike against my stomach,
       Having alike your cause? Of this my letters
       Before did satisfy you. If you'll patch a quarrel, 750
       As matter whole you have not to make it with,
       It must not be with this.

     * Octavius. You praise yourself
       By laying defects of judgment to me; but
       You patch'd up your excuses. 755

     * Antony. Not so, not so;
       I know you could not lack, I am certain on't,
       Very necessity of this thought, that I,
       Your partner in the cause 'gainst which he fought,
       Could not with graceful eyes attend those wars 760
       Which fronted mine own peace. As for my wife,
       I would you had her spirit in such another:
       The third o' the world is yours; which with a snaffle
       You may pace easy, but not such a wife.

     * Domitius Enobarus. Would we had all such wives, that the men might
       go 765
       to wars with the women!

     * Antony. So much uncurbable, her garboils, Caesar
       Made out of her impatience, which not wanted
       Shrewdness of policy too, I grieving grant
       Did you too much disquiet: for that you must 770
       But say, I could not help it.

     * Octavius. I wrote to you
       When rioting in Alexandria; you
       Did pocket up my letters, and with taunts
       Did gibe my missive out of audience. 775

     * Antony. Sir,
       He fell upon me ere admitted: then
       Three kings I had newly feasted, and did want
       Of what I was i' the morning: but next day
       I told him of myself; which was as much 780
       As to have ask'd him pardon. Let this fellow
       Be nothing of our strife; if we contend,
       Out of our question wipe him.

     * Octavius. You have broken
       The article of your oath; which you shall never 785
       Have tongue to charge me with.

     * Lepidus. Soft, Caesar!

     * Antony. No,
       Lepidus, let him speak:
       The honour is sacred which he talks on now, 790
       Supposing that I lack'd it. But, on, Caesar;
       The article of my oath.

     * Octavius. To lend me arms and aid when I required them;
       The which you both denied.

     * Antony. Neglected, rather; 795
       And then when poison'd hours had bound me up
       From mine own knowledge. As nearly as I may,
       I'll play the penitent to you: but mine honesty
       Shall not make poor my greatness, nor my power
       Work without it. Truth is, that Fulvia, 800
       To have me out of Egypt, made wars here;
       For which myself, the ignorant motive, do
       So far ask pardon as befits mine honour
       To stoop in such a case.

     * Lepidus. 'Tis noble spoken. 805

     * Mecaenas. If it might please you, to enforce no further
       The griefs between ye: to forget them quite
       Were to remember that the present need
       Speaks to atone you.

     * Lepidus. Worthily spoken, Mecaenas. 810

     * Domitius Enobarus. Or, if you borrow one another's love for the
       instant, you may, when you hear no more words of
       Pompey, return it again: you shall have time to
       wrangle in when you have nothing else to do.

     * Antony. Thou art a soldier only: speak no more. 815

     * Domitius Enobarus. That truth should be silent I had almost forgot.

     * Antony. You wrong this presence; therefore speak no more.

     * Domitius Enobarus. Go to, then; your considerate stone.

     * Octavius. I do not much dislike the matter, but
       The manner of his speech; for't cannot be 820
       We shall remain in friendship, our conditions
       So differing in their acts. Yet if I knew
       What hoop should hold us stanch, from edge to edge
       O' the world I would pursue it.

     * Agrippa. Give me leave, Caesar,— 825

     * Octavius. Speak, Agrippa.

     * Agrippa. Thou hast a sister by the mother's side,
       Admired Octavia: great Mark Antony
       Is now a widower.

     * Octavius. Say not so, Agrippa: 830
       If Cleopatra heard you, your reproof
       Were well deserved of rashness.

     * Antony. I am not married, Caesar: let me hear
       Agrippa further speak.

     * Agrippa. To hold you in perpetual amity, 835
       To make you brothers, and to knit your hearts
       With an unslipping knot, take Antony
       Octavia to his wife; whose beauty claims
       No worse a husband than the best of men;
       Whose virtue and whose general graces speak 840
       That which none else can utter. By this marriage,
       All little jealousies, which now seem great,
       And all great fears, which now import their dangers,
       Would then be nothing: truths would be tales,
       Where now half tales be truths: her love to both 845
       Would, each to other and all loves to both,
       Draw after her. Pardon what I have spoke;
       For 'tis a studied, not a present thought,
       By duty ruminated.

     * Antony. Will Caesar speak? 850

     * Octavius. Not till he hears how Antony is touch'd
       With what is spoke already.

     * Antony. What power is in Agrippa,
       If I would say, 'Agrippa, be it so,'
       To make this good? 855

     * Octavius. The power of Caesar, and
       His power unto Octavia.

     * Antony. May I never
       To this good purpose, that so fairly shows,
       Dream of impediment! Let me have thy hand: 860
       Further this act of grace: and from this hour
       The heart of brothers govern in our loves
       And sway our great designs!

     * Octavius. There is my hand.
       A sister I bequeath you, whom no brother 865
       Did ever love so dearly: let her live
       To join our kingdoms and our hearts; and never
       Fly off our loves again!

     * Lepidus. Happily, amen!

     * Antony. I did not think to draw my sword 'gainst Pompey; 870
       For he hath laid strange courtesies and great
       Of late upon me: I must thank him only,
       Lest my remembrance suffer ill report;
       At heel of that, defy him.

     * Lepidus. Time calls upon's: 875
       Of us must Pompey presently be sought,
       Or else he seeks out us.

     * Antony. Where lies he?

     * Octavius. About the mount Misenum.

     * Antony. What is his strength by land? 880

     * Octavius. Great and increasing: but by sea
       He is an absolute master.

     * Antony. So is the fame.
       Would we had spoke together! Haste we for it:
       Yet, ere we put ourselves in arms, dispatch we 885
       The business we have talk'd of.

     * Octavius. With most gladness:
       And do invite you to my sister's view,
       Whither straight I'll lead you.

     * Antony. Let us, Lepidus, 890
       Not lack your company.

     * Lepidus. Noble Antony,
       Not sickness should detain me.
       [Flourish. Exeunt OCTAVIUS CAESAR, MARK ANTONY,]
       and LEPIDUS] 895

     * Mecaenas. Welcome from Egypt, sir.

     * Domitius Enobarus. Half the heart of Caesar, worthy Mecaenas! My
       honourable friend, Agrippa!

     * Agrippa. Good Enobarbus!

     * Mecaenas. We have cause to be glad that matters are so well 900
       digested. You stayed well by 't in Egypt.

     * Domitius Enobarus. Ay, sir; we did sleep day out of countenance,
       and
       made the night light with drinking.

     * Mecaenas. Eight wild-boars roasted whole at a breakfast, and
       but twelve persons there; is this true? 905

     * Domitius Enobarus. This was but as a fly by an eagle: we had much
       more
       monstrous matter of feast, which worthily deserved noting.

     * Mecaenas. She's a most triumphant lady, if report be square to
       her.

     * Domitius Enobarus. When she first met Mark Antony, she pursed up
       910
       his heart, upon the river of Cydnus.

     * Agrippa. There she appeared indeed; or my reporter devised
       well for her.

     * Domitius Enobarus. I will tell you.
       The barge she sat in, like a burnish'd throne, 915
       Burn'd on the water: the poop was beaten gold;
       Purple the sails, and so perfumed that
       The winds were love-sick with them; the oars were silver,
       Which to the tune of flutes kept stroke, and made
       The water which they beat to follow faster, 920
       As amorous of their strokes. For her own person,
       It beggar'd all description: she did lie
       In her pavilion—cloth-of-gold of tissue—
       O'er-picturing that Venus where we see
       The fancy outwork nature: on each side her 925
       Stood pretty dimpled boys, like smiling Cupids,
       With divers-colour'd fans, whose wind did seem
       To glow the delicate cheeks which they did cool,
       And what they undid did.

     * Agrippa. O, rare for Antony! 930

     * Domitius Enobarus. Her gentlewomen, like the Nereides,
       So many mermaids, tended her i' the eyes,
       And made their bends adornings: at the helm
       A seeming mermaid steers: the silken tackle
       Swell with the touches of those flower-soft hands, 935
       That yarely frame the office. From the barge
       A strange invisible perfume hits the sense
       Of the adjacent wharfs. The city cast
       Her people out upon her; and Antony,
       Enthroned i' the market-place, did sit alone, 940
       Whistling to the air; which, but for vacancy,
       Had gone to gaze on Cleopatra too,
       And made a gap in nature.

     * Agrippa. Rare Egyptian!

     * Domitius Enobarus. Upon her landing, Antony sent to her, 945
       Invited her to supper: she replied,
       It should be better he became her guest;
       Which she entreated: our courteous Antony,
       Whom ne'er the word of 'No' woman heard speak,
       Being barber'd ten times o'er, goes to the feast, 950
       And for his ordinary pays his heart
       For what his eyes eat only.

     * Agrippa. Royal wench!
       She made great Caesar lay his sword to bed:
       He plough'd her, and she cropp'd. 955

     * Domitius Enobarus. I saw her once
       Hop forty paces through the public street;
       And having lost her breath, she spoke, and panted,
       That she did make defect perfection,
       And, breathless, power breathe forth. 960

     * Mecaenas. Now Antony must leave her utterly.

     * Domitius Enobarus. Never; he will not:
       Age cannot wither her, nor custom stale
       Her infinite variety: other women cloy
       The appetites they feed: but she makes hungry 965
       Where most she satisfies; for vilest things
       Become themselves in her: that the holy priests
       Bless her when she is riggish.

     * Mecaenas. If beauty, wisdom, modesty, can settle
       The heart of Antony, Octavia is 970
       A blessed lottery to him.

     * Agrippa. Let us go.
       Good Enobarbus, make yourself my guest
       Whilst you abide here.

     * Domitius Enobarus. Humbly, sir, I thank you. 975

   The same. OCTAVIUS CAESAR’s house.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   [Enter MARK ANTONY, OCTAVIUS CAESAR, OCTAVIA between] [p]them, and
   Attendants]
     * Antony. The world and my great office will sometimes
       Divide me from your bosom. 980

     * Octavia. All which time
       Before the gods my knee shall bow my prayers
       To them for you.

     * Antony. Good night, sir. My Octavia,
       Read not my blemishes in the world's report: 985
       I have not kept my square; but that to come
       Shall all be done by the rule. Good night, dear lady.
       Good night, sir.

     * Octavius. Good night.

   [Exeunt OCTAVIUS CAESAR and OCTAVIA]

   [Enter Soothsayer]
     * Antony. Now, sirrah; you do wish yourself in Egypt?

     * Soothsayer. Would I had never come from thence, nor you Thither!

     * Antony. If you can, your reason?

     * Soothsayer. I see it in 995
       My motion, have it not in my tongue: but yet
       Hie you to Egypt again.

     * Antony. Say to me,
       Whose fortunes shall rise higher, Caesar's or mine?

     * Soothsayer. Caesar's. 1000
       Therefore, O Antony, stay not by his side:
       Thy demon, that's thy spirit which keeps thee, is
       Noble, courageous high, unmatchable,
       Where Caesar's is not; but, near him, thy angel
       Becomes a fear, as being o'erpower'd: therefore 1005
       Make space enough between you.

     * Antony. Speak this no more.

     * Soothsayer. To none but thee; no more, but when to thee.
       If thou dost play with him at any game,
       Thou art sure to lose; and, of that natural luck, 1010
       He beats thee 'gainst the odds: thy lustre thickens,
       When he shines by: I say again, thy spirit
       Is all afraid to govern thee near him;
       But, he away, 'tis noble.

     * Antony. Get thee gone: 1015
       Say to Ventidius I would speak with him:
       [Exit Soothsayer]
       He shall to Parthia. Be it art or hap,
       He hath spoken true: the very dice obey him;
       And in our sports my better cunning faints 1020
       Under his chance: if we draw lots, he speeds;
       His cocks do win the battle still of mine,
       When it is all to nought; and his quails ever
       Beat mine, inhoop'd, at odds. I will to Egypt:
       And though I make this marriage for my peace, 1025
       I' the east my pleasure lies.
       [Enter VENTIDIUS]
       O, come, Ventidius,
       You must to Parthia: your commission's ready;
       Follow me, and receive't. 1030

       Will e'en but kiss Octavia, and we'll follow.

     * Lepidus. Till I shall see you in your soldier's dress,
       Which will become you both, farewell.

     * Mecaenas. We shall,
       As I conceive the journey, be at the Mount 1040
       Before you, Lepidus.

     * Lepidus. Your way is shorter;
       My purposes do draw me much about:
       You'll win two days upon me.

   Alexandria. CLEOPATRA’s palace.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   [Enter CLEOPATRA, CHARMIAN, IRAS, and ALEXAS]
     * Cleopatra. Give me some music; music, moody food
       Of us that trade in love. 1050

     * Attendants. The music, ho!

   [Enter MARDIAN]
     * Cleopatra. Let it alone; let's to billiards: come, Charmian.

     * Charmian. My arm is sore; best play with Mardian.

     * Cleopatra. As well a woman with an eunuch play'd 1055
       As with a woman. Come, you'll play with me, sir?

     * Mardian. As well as I can, madam.

     * Cleopatra. And when good will is show'd, though't come
       too short,
       The actor may plead pardon. I'll none now: 1060
       Give me mine angle; we'll to the river: there,
       My music playing far off, I will betray
       Tawny-finn'd fishes; my bended hook shall pierce
       Their slimy jaws; and, as I draw them up,
       I'll think them every one an Antony, 1065
       And say 'Ah, ha! you're caught.'

     * Charmian. 'Twas merry when
       You wager'd on your angling; when your diver
       Did hang a salt-fish on his hook, which he
       With fervency drew up. 1070

     * Cleopatra. That time,—O times!—
       I laugh'd him out of patience; and that night
       I laugh'd him into patience; and next morn,
       Ere the ninth hour, I drunk him to his bed;
       Then put my tires and mantles on him, whilst 1075
       I wore his sword Philippan.
       [Enter a Messenger]
       O, from Italy
       Ram thou thy fruitful tidings in mine ears,
       That long time have been barren. 1080

     * Messenger. Madam, madam,—

     * Cleopatra. Antonius dead!—If thou say so, villain,
       Thou kill'st thy mistress: but well and free,
       If thou so yield him, there is gold, and here
       My bluest veins to kiss; a hand that kings 1085
       Have lipp'd, and trembled kissing.

     * Messenger. First, madam, he is well.

     * Cleopatra. Why, there's more gold.
       But, sirrah, mark, we use
       To say the dead are well: bring it to that, 1090
       The gold I give thee will I melt and pour
       Down thy ill-uttering throat.

     * Messenger. Good madam, hear me.

     * Cleopatra. Well, go to, I will;
       But there's no goodness in thy face: if Antony 1095
       Be free and healthful,—so tart a favour
       To trumpet such good tidings! If not well,
       Thou shouldst come like a Fury crown'd with snakes,
       Not like a formal man.

     * Messenger. Will't please you hear me? 1100

     * Cleopatra. I have a mind to strike thee ere thou speak'st:
       Yet if thou say Antony lives, is well,
       Or friends with Caesar, or not captive to him,
       I'll set thee in a shower of gold, and hail
       Rich pearls upon thee. 1105

     * Messenger. Madam, he's well.

     * Cleopatra. Well said.

     * Messenger. And friends with Caesar.

     * Cleopatra. Thou'rt an honest man.

     * Messenger. Caesar and he are greater friends than ever. 1110

     * Cleopatra. Make thee a fortune from me.

     * Messenger. But yet, madam,—

     * Cleopatra. I do not like 'But yet,' it does allay
       The good precedence; fie upon 'But yet'!
       'But yet' is as a gaoler to bring forth 1115
       Some monstrous malefactor. Prithee, friend,
       Pour out the pack of matter to mine ear,
       The good and bad together: he's friends with Caesar:
       In state of health thou say'st; and thou say'st free.

     * Messenger. Free, madam! no; I made no such report: 1120
       He's bound unto Octavia.

     * Cleopatra. For what good turn?

     * Messenger. For the best turn i' the bed.

     * Cleopatra. I am pale, Charmian.

     * Messenger. Madam, he's married to Octavia. 1125

     * Cleopatra. The most infectious pestilence upon thee!

   [Strikes him down]
     * Messenger. Good madam, patience.

     * Cleopatra. What say you? Hence,
       [Strikes him again] 1130
       Horrible villain! or I'll spurn thine eyes
       Like balls before me; I'll unhair thy head:
       [She hales him up and down]
       Thou shalt be whipp'd with wire, and stew'd in brine,
       Smarting in lingering pickle. 1135

     * Messenger. Gracious madam,
       I that do bring the news made not the match.

     * Cleopatra. Say 'tis not so, a province I will give thee,
       And make thy fortunes proud: the blow thou hadst
       Shall make thy peace for moving me to rage; 1140
       And I will boot thee with what gift beside
       Thy modesty can beg.

     * Messenger. He's married, madam.

     * Cleopatra. Rogue, thou hast lived too long.

   [Draws a knife]
     * Messenger. Nay, then I'll run.
       What mean you, madam? I have made no fault.

   [Exit]
     * Charmian. Good madam, keep yourself within yourself:
       The man is innocent. 1150

     * Cleopatra. Some innocents 'scape not the thunderbolt.
       Melt Egypt into Nile! and kindly creatures
       Turn all to serpents! Call the slave again:
       Though I am mad, I will not bite him: call.

     * Charmian. He is afeard to come. 1155

     * Cleopatra. I will not hurt him.
       [Exit CHARMIAN]
       These hands do lack nobility, that they strike
       A meaner than myself; since I myself
       Have given myself the cause. 1160
       [Re-enter CHARMIAN and Messenger]
       Come hither, sir.
       Though it be honest, it is never good
       To bring bad news: give to a gracious message.
       An host of tongues; but let ill tidings tell 1165
       Themselves when they be felt.

     * Messenger. I have done my duty.

     * Cleopatra. Is he married?
       I cannot hate thee worser than I do,
       If thou again say 'Yes.' 1170

     * Messenger. He's married, madam.

     * Cleopatra. The gods confound thee! dost thou hold there still?

     * Messenger. Should I lie, madam?

     * Cleopatra. O, I would thou didst,
       So half my Egypt were submerged and made 1175
       A cistern for scaled snakes! Go, get thee hence:
       Hadst thou Narcissus in thy face, to me
       Thou wouldst appear most ugly. He is married?

     * Messenger. I crave your highness' pardon.

     * Cleopatra. He is married? 1180

     * Messenger. Take no offence that I would not offend you:
       To punish me for what you make me do.
       Seems much unequal: he's married to Octavia.

     * Cleopatra. O, that his fault should make a knave of thee,
       That art not what thou'rt sure of! Get thee hence: 1185
       The merchandise which thou hast brought from Rome
       Are all too dear for me: lie they upon thy hand,
       And be undone by 'em!

   [Exit Messenger]
     * Charmian. Good your highness, patience. 1190

     * Cleopatra. In praising Antony, I have dispraised Caesar.

     * Charmian. Many times, madam.

     * Cleopatra. I am paid for't now.
       Lead me from hence:
       I faint: O Iras, Charmian! 'tis no matter. 1195
       Go to the fellow, good Alexas; bid him
       Report the feature of Octavia, her years,
       Her inclination, let him not leave out
       The colour of her hair: bring me word quickly.
       [Exit ALEXAS] 1200
       Let him for ever go:—let him not—Charmian,
       Though he be painted one way like a Gorgon,
       The other way's a Mars. Bid you Alexas
       [To MARDIAN]
       Bring me word how tall she is. Pity me, Charmian, 1205
       But do not speak to me. Lead me to my chamber.

   Act II, Scene 6

   Near Misenum.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   [Flourish. Enter POMPEY and MENAS at one door,] [p]with drum and
   trumpet: at another, OCTAVIUS CAESAR, [p]MARK ANTONY, LEPIDUS, DOMITIUS
   ENOBARBUS, MECAENAS, [p]with Soldiers marching]
     * Pompey. Your hostages I have, so have you mine;
       And we shall talk before we fight.

     * Octavius. Most meet
       That first we come to words; and therefore have we 1215
       Our written purposes before us sent;
       Which, if thou hast consider'd, let us know
       If 'twill tie up thy discontented sword,
       And carry back to Sicily much tall youth
       That else must perish here. 1220

     * Pompey. To you all three,
       The senators alone of this great world,
       Chief factors for the gods, I do not know
       Wherefore my father should revengers want,
       Having a son and friends; since Julius Caesar, 1225
       Who at Philippi the good Brutus ghosted,
       There saw you labouring for him. What was't
       That moved pale Cassius to conspire; and what
       Made the all-honour'd, honest Roman, Brutus,
       With the arm'd rest, courtiers and beauteous freedom, 1230
       To drench the Capitol; but that they would
       Have one man but a man? And that is it
       Hath made me rig my navy; at whose burthen
       The anger'd ocean foams; with which I meant
       To scourge the ingratitude that despiteful Rome 1235
       Cast on my noble father.

     * Octavius. Take your time.

     * Antony. Thou canst not fear us, Pompey, with thy sails;
       We'll speak with thee at sea: at land, thou know'st
       How much we do o'er-count thee. 1240

     * Pompey. At land, indeed,
       Thou dost o'er-count me of my father's house:
       But, since the cuckoo builds not for himself,
       Remain in't as thou mayst.

     * Lepidus. Be pleased to tell us— 1245
       For this is from the present—how you take
       The offers we have sent you.

     * Octavius. There's the point.

     * Antony. Which do not be entreated to, but weigh
       What it is worth embraced. 1250

     * Octavius. And what may follow,
       To try a larger fortune.

     * Pompey. You have made me offer
       Of Sicily, Sardinia; and I must
       Rid all the sea of pirates; then, to send 1255
       Measures of wheat to Rome; this 'greed upon
       To part with unhack'd edges, and bear back
       Our targes undinted.

     * Octavius. [with Antony and Lepidus] That's our offer.

     * Pompey. Know, then, 1260
       I came before you here a man prepared
       To take this offer: but Mark Antony
       Put me to some impatience: though I lose
       The praise of it by telling, you must know,
       When Caesar and your brother were at blows, 1265
       Your mother came to Sicily and did find
       Her welcome friendly.

     * Antony. I have heard it, Pompey;
       And am well studied for a liberal thanks
       Which I do owe you. 1270

     * Pompey. Let me have your hand:
       I did not think, sir, to have met you here.

     * Antony. The beds i' the east are soft; and thanks to you,
       That call'd me timelier than my purpose hither;
       For I have gain'd by 't. 1275

     * Octavius. Since I saw you last,
       There is a change upon you.

     * Pompey. Well, I know not
       What counts harsh fortune casts upon my face;
       But in my bosom shall she never come, 1280
       To make my heart her vassal.

     * Lepidus. Well met here.

     * Pompey. I hope so, Lepidus. Thus we are agreed:
       I crave our composition may be written,
       And seal'd between us. 1285

     * Octavius. That's the next to do.

     * Pompey. We'll feast each other ere we part; and let's
       Draw lots who shall begin.

     * Antony. That will I, Pompey.

     * Pompey. No, Antony, take the lot: but, first 1290
       Or last, your fine Egyptian cookery
       Shall have the fame. I have heard that Julius Caesar
       Grew fat with feasting there.

     * Antony. You have heard much.

     * Pompey. I have fair meanings, sir. 1295

     * Antony. And fair words to them.

     * Pompey. Then so much have I heard:
       And I have heard, Apollodorus carried—

     * Domitius Enobarus. No more of that: he did so.

     * Pompey. What, I pray you? 1300

     * Domitius Enobarus. A certain queen to Caesar in a mattress.

     * Pompey. I know thee now: how farest thou, soldier?

     * Domitius Enobarus. Well;
       And well am like to do; for, I perceive,
       Four feasts are toward. 1305

     * Pompey. Let me shake thy hand;
       I never hated thee: I have seen thee fight,
       When I have envied thy behavior.

     * Domitius Enobarus. Sir,
       I never loved you much; but I ha' praised ye, 1310
       When you have well deserved ten times as much
       As I have said you did.

     * Pompey. Enjoy thy plainness,
       It nothing ill becomes thee.
       Aboard my galley I invite you all: 1315
       Will you lead, lords?

     * Octavius. [with Antony and Lepidus]

     * Pompey. Come.

   [Exeunt all but MENAS and ENOBARBUS]
     * Menas. [Aside] Thy father, Pompey, would ne'er have 1320
       made this treaty.—You and I have known, sir.

     * Domitius Enobarus. At sea, I think.

     * Menas. We have, sir.

     * Domitius Enobarus. You have done well by water.

     * Menas. And you by land. 1325

     * Domitius Enobarus. I will praise any man that will praise me;
       though it
       cannot be denied what I have done by land.

     * Menas. Nor what I have done by water.

     * Domitius Enobarus. Yes, something you can deny for your own
       safety: you have been a great thief by sea. 1330

     * Menas. And you by land.

     * Domitius Enobarus. There I deny my land service. But give me your
       hand, Menas: if our eyes had authority, here they
       might take two thieves kissing.

     * Menas. All men's faces are true, whatsome'er their hands are. 1335

     * Domitius Enobarus. But there is never a fair woman has a true face.

     * Menas. No slander; they steal hearts.

     * Domitius Enobarus. We came hither to fight with you.

     * Menas. For my part, I am sorry it is turned to a drinking.
       Pompey doth this day laugh away his fortune. 1340

     * Domitius Enobarus. If he do, sure, he cannot weep't back again.

     * Menas. You've said, sir. We looked not for Mark Antony
       here: pray you, is he married to Cleopatra?

     * Domitius Enobarus. Caesar's sister is called Octavia.

     * Menas. True, sir; she was the wife of Caius Marcellus. 1345

     * Domitius Enobarus. But she is now the wife of Marcus Antonius.

     * Menas. Pray ye, sir?

     * Domitius Enobarus. 'Tis true.

     * Menas. Then is Caesar and he for ever knit together.

     * Domitius Enobarus. If I were bound to divine of this unity, I would
       1350
       not prophesy so.

     * Menas. I think the policy of that purpose made more in the
       marriage than the love of the parties.

     * Domitius Enobarus. I think so too. But you shall find, the band
       that
       seems to tie their friendship together will be the 1355
       very strangler of their amity: Octavia is of a
       holy, cold, and still conversation.

     * Menas. Who would not have his wife so?

     * Domitius Enobarus. Not he that himself is not so; which is Mark
       Antony.
       He will to his Egyptian dish again: then shall the 1360
       sighs of Octavia blow the fire up in Caesar; and, as
       I said before, that which is the strength of their
       amity shall prove the immediate author of their
       variance. Antony will use his affection where it is:
       he married but his occasion here. 1365

     * Menas. And thus it may be. Come, sir, will you aboard?
       I have a health for you.

     * Domitius Enobarus. I shall take it, sir: we have used our throats
       in Egypt.

     * Menas. Come, let's away.

   [Exeunt]

   Act II, Scene 7

   On board POMPEY’s galley, off Misenum.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   [Music plays. Enter two or three Servants with] [p]a banquet]
     * First Servant. Here they'll be, man. Some o' their plants are
       ill-rooted already: the least wind i' the world
       will blow them down. 1375

     * Second Servant. Lepidus is high-coloured.

     * First Servant. They have made him drink alms-drink.

     * Second Servant. As they pinch one another by the disposition, he
       cries out 'No more;' reconciles them to his
       entreaty, and himself to the drink. 1380

     * First Servant. But it raises the greater war between him and
       his discretion.

     * Second Servant. Why, this is to have a name in great men's
       fellowship: I had as lief have a reed that will do
       me no service as a partisan I could not heave. 1385

     * First Servant. To be called into a huge sphere, and not to be seen
       to move in't, are the holes where eyes should be,
       which pitifully disaster the cheeks.
       [A sennet sounded. Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR, MARK]
       ANTONY, LEPIDUS, POMPEY, AGRIPPA, MECAENAS, 1390
       DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS, MENAS, with other captains]

     * Antony. [To OCTAVIUS CAESAR] Thus do they, sir: they take
       the flow o' the Nile
       By certain scales i' the pyramid; they know,
       By the height, the lowness, or the mean, if dearth 1395
       Or foison follow: the higher Nilus swells,
       The more it promises: as it ebbs, the seedsman
       Upon the slime and ooze scatters his grain,
       And shortly comes to harvest.

     * Lepidus. You've strange serpents there. 1400

     * Antony. Ay, Lepidus.

     * Lepidus. Your serpent of Egypt is bred now of your mud by the
       operation of your sun: so is your crocodile.

     * Antony. They are so.

     * Pompey. Sit,—and some wine! A health to Lepidus! 1405

     * Lepidus. I am not so well as I should be, but I'll ne'er out.

     * Domitius Enobarus. Not till you have slept; I fear me you'll be in
       till then.

     * Lepidus. Nay, certainly, I have heard the Ptolemies'
       pyramises are very goodly things; without
       contradiction, I have heard that. 1410

     * Menas. [Aside to POMPEY] Pompey, a word.

     * Pompey. [Aside to MENAS] Say in mine ear:
       what is't?

     * Menas. [Aside to POMPEY] Forsake thy seat, I do beseech
       thee, captain, 1415
       And hear me speak a word.

     * Pompey. [Aside to MENAS] Forbear me till anon.
       This wine for Lepidus!

     * Lepidus. What manner o' thing is your crocodile?

     * Antony. It is shaped, sir, like itself; and it is as broad 1420
       as it hath breadth: it is just so high as it is,
       and moves with its own organs: it lives by that
       which nourisheth it; and the elements once out of
       it, it transmigrates.

     * Lepidus. What colour is it of? 1425

     * Antony. Of it own colour too.

     * Lepidus. 'Tis a strange serpent.

     * Antony. 'Tis so. And the tears of it are wet.

     * Octavius. Will this description satisfy him?

     * Antony. With the health that Pompey gives him, else he is a 1430
       very epicure.

     * Pompey. [Aside to MENAS] Go hang, sir, hang! Tell me of
       that? away!
       Do as I bid you. Where's this cup I call'd for?

     * Menas. [Aside to POMPEY] If for the sake of merit thou 1435
       wilt hear me,
       Rise from thy stool.

     * Pompey. [Aside to MENAS] I think thou'rt mad.
       The matter?

   [Rises, and walks aside]
     * Menas. I have ever held my cap off to thy fortunes.

     * Pompey. Thou hast served me with much faith. What's else to say?
       Be jolly, lords.

     * Antony. These quick-sands, Lepidus,
       Keep off them, for you sink. 1445

     * Menas. Wilt thou be lord of all the world?

     * Pompey. What say'st thou?

     * Menas. Wilt thou be lord of the whole world? That's twice.

     * Pompey. How should that be?

     * Menas. But entertain it, 1450
       And, though thou think me poor, I am the man
       Will give thee all the world.

     * Pompey. Hast thou drunk well?

     * Menas. Now, Pompey, I have kept me from the cup.
       Thou art, if thou darest be, the earthly Jove: 1455
       Whate'er the ocean pales, or sky inclips,
       Is thine, if thou wilt ha't.

     * Pompey. Show me which way.

     * Menas. These three world-sharers, these competitors,
       Are in thy vessel: let me cut the cable; 1460
       And, when we are put off, fall to their throats:
       All there is thine.

     * Pompey. Ah, this thou shouldst have done,
       And not have spoke on't! In me 'tis villany;
       In thee't had been good service. Thou must know, 1465
       'Tis not my profit that does lead mine honour;
       Mine honour, it. Repent that e'er thy tongue
       Hath so betray'd thine act: being done unknown,
       I should have found it afterwards well done;
       But must condemn it now. Desist, and drink. 1470

     * Menas. [Aside] For this,
       I'll never follow thy pall'd fortunes more.
       Who seeks, and will not take when once 'tis offer'd,
       Shall never find it more.

     * Pompey. This health to Lepidus! 1475

     * Antony. Bear him ashore. I'll pledge it for him, Pompey.

     * Domitius Enobarus. Here's to thee, Menas!

     * Menas. Enobarbus, welcome!

     * Pompey. Fill till the cup be hid.

     * Domitius Enobarus. There's a strong fellow, Menas. 1480

   [Pointing to the Attendant who carries off LEPIDUS]
     * Menas. Why?

     * Domitius Enobarus. A' bears the third part of the world, man;
       see'st
       not?

     * Menas. The third part, then, is drunk: would it were all, 1485
       That it might go on wheels!

     * Domitius Enobarus. Drink thou; increase the reels.

     * Menas. Come.

     * Pompey. This is not yet an Alexandrian feast.

     * Antony. It ripens towards it. Strike the vessels, ho? 1490
       Here is to Caesar!

     * Octavius. I could well forbear't.
       It's monstrous labour, when I wash my brain,
       And it grows fouler.

     * Antony. Be a child o' the time. 1495

     * Octavius. Possess it, I'll make answer:
       But I had rather fast from all four days
       Than drink so much in one.

     * Domitius Enobarus. Ha, my brave emperor!
       [To MARK ANTONY] 1500
       Shall we dance now the Egyptian Bacchanals,
       And celebrate our drink?

     * Pompey. Let's ha't, good soldier.

     * Antony. Come, let's all take hands,
       Till that the conquering wine hath steep'd our sense 1505
       In soft and delicate Lethe.

     * Domitius Enobarus. All take hands.
       Make battery to our ears with the loud music:
       The while I'll place you: then the boy shall sing;
       The holding every man shall bear as loud 1510
       As his strong sides can volley.
       [Music plays. DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS places them]
       hand in hand]
       THE SONG.
       Come, thou monarch of the vine, 1515
       Plumpy Bacchus with pink eyne!
       In thy fats our cares be drown'd,
       With thy grapes our hairs be crown'd:
       Cup us, till the world go round,
       Cup us, till the world go round! 1520

     * Octavius. What would you more? Pompey, good night. Good brother,
       Let me request you off: our graver business
       Frowns at this levity. Gentle lords, let's part;
       You see we have burnt our cheeks: strong Enobarb
       Is weaker than the wine; and mine own tongue 1525
       Splits what it speaks: the wild disguise hath almost
       Antick'd us all. What needs more words? Good night.
       Good Antony, your hand.

     * Pompey. I'll try you on the shore.

     * Antony. And shall, sir; give's your hand. 1530

     * Pompey. O Antony,
       You have my father's house,—But, what? we are friends.
       Come, down into the boat.

     * Domitius Enobarus. Take heed you fall not.
       [Exeunt all but DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS and MENAS] 1535
       Menas, I'll not on shore.

     * Menas. No, to my cabin.
       These drums! these trumpets, flutes! what!
       Let Neptune hear we bid a loud farewell
       To these great fellows: sound and be hang'd, sound out! 1540

   [Sound a flourish, with drums]
     * Domitius Enobarus. Ho! says a' There's my cap.

     * Menas. Ho! Noble captain, come.

   [Exeunt]

   Act III, Scene 1

   A plain in Syria.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   [Enter VENTIDIUS as it were in triumph, with SILIUS,] [p]and other
   Romans, Officers, and Soldiers; the dead [p]body of PACORUS borne
   before him]
     * Ventidius. Now, darting Parthia, art thou struck; and now
       Pleased fortune does of Marcus Crassus' death
       Make me revenger. Bear the king's son's body 1550
       Before our army. Thy Pacorus, Orodes,
       Pays this for Marcus Crassus.

     * Silius. Noble Ventidius,
       Whilst yet with Parthian blood thy sword is warm,
       The fugitive Parthians follow; spur through Media, 1555
       Mesopotamia, and the shelters whither
       The routed fly: so thy grand captain Antony
       Shall set thee on triumphant chariots and
       Put garlands on thy head.

     * Ventidius. O Silius, Silius, 1560
       I have done enough; a lower place, note well,
       May make too great an act: for learn this, Silius;
       Better to leave undone, than by our deed
       Acquire too high a fame when him we serve's away.
       Caesar and Antony have ever won 1565
       More in their officer than person: Sossius,
       One of my place in Syria, his lieutenant,
       For quick accumulation of renown,
       Which he achieved by the minute, lost his favour.
       Who does i' the wars more than his captain can 1570
       Becomes his captain's captain: and ambition,
       The soldier's virtue, rather makes choice of loss,
       Than gain which darkens him.
       I could do more to do Antonius good,
       But 'twould offend him; and in his offence 1575
       Should my performance perish.

     * Silius. Thou hast, Ventidius,
       that
       Without the which a soldier, and his sword,
       Grants scarce distinction. Thou wilt write to Antony! 1580

     * Ventidius. I'll humbly signify what in his name,
       That magical word of war, we have effected;
       How, with his banners and his well-paid ranks,
       The ne'er-yet-beaten horse of Parthia
       We have jaded out o' the field. 1585

     * Silius. Where is he now?

     * Ventidius. He purposeth to Athens: whither, with what haste
       The weight we must convey with's will permit,
       We shall appear before him. On there; pass along!

   [Exeunt]

   Act III, Scene 2

   Rome. An ante-chamber in OCTAVIUS CAESAR’s house.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   [Enter AGRIPPA at one door, DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS] [p]at another]
     * Agrippa. What, are the brothers parted?

     * Domitius Enobarus. They have dispatch'd with Pompey, he is gone;
       The other three are sealing. Octavia weeps 1595
       To part from Rome; Caesar is sad; and Lepidus,
       Since Pompey's feast, as Menas says, is troubled
       With the green sickness.

     * Agrippa. 'Tis a noble Lepidus.

     * Domitius Enobarus. A very fine one: O, how he loves Caesar! 1600

     * Agrippa. Nay, but how dearly he adores Mark Antony!

     * Domitius Enobarus. Caesar? Why, he's the Jupiter of men.

     * Agrippa. What's Antony? The god of Jupiter.

     * Domitius Enobarus. Spake you of Caesar? How! the non-pareil!

     * Agrippa. O Antony! O thou Arabian bird! 1605

     * Domitius Enobarus. Would you praise Caesar, say 'Caesar:' go no
       further.

     * Agrippa. Indeed, he plied them both with excellent praises.

     * Domitius Enobarus. But he loves Caesar best; yet he loves Antony:
       Ho! hearts, tongues, figures, scribes, bards,
       poets, cannot 1610
       Think, speak, cast, write, sing, number, ho!
       His love to Antony. But as for Caesar,
       Kneel down, kneel down, and wonder.

     * Agrippa. Both he loves.

     * Domitius Enobarus. They are his shards, and he their beetle. 1615
       [Trumpets within]
       So;
       This is to horse. Adieu, noble Agrippa.

     * Agrippa. Good fortune, worthy soldier; and farewell.

   [Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR, MARK ANTONY, LEPIDUS, and OCTAVIA]
     * Antony. No further, sir.

     * Octavius. You take from me a great part of myself;
       Use me well in 't. Sister, prove such a wife
       As my thoughts make thee, and as my farthest band
       Shall pass on thy approof. Most noble Antony, 1625
       Let not the piece of virtue, which is set
       Betwixt us as the cement of our love,
       To keep it builded, be the ram to batter
       The fortress of it; for better might we
       Have loved without this mean, if on both parts 1630
       This be not cherish'd.

     * Antony. Make me not offended
       In your distrust.

     * Octavius. I have said.

     * Antony. You shall not find, 1635
       Though you be therein curious, the least cause
       For what you seem to fear: so, the gods keep you,
       And make the hearts of Romans serve your ends!
       We will here part.

     * Octavius. Farewell, my dearest sister, fare thee well: 1640
       The elements be kind to thee, and make
       Thy spirits all of comfort! fare thee well.

     * Octavia. My noble brother!

     * Antony. The April 's in her eyes: it is love's spring,
       And these the showers to bring it on. Be cheerful. 1645

     * Octavia. Sir, look well to my husband's house; and—

     * Octavius. What, Octavia?

     * Octavia. I'll tell you in your ear.

     * Antony. Her tongue will not obey her heart, nor can
       Her heart inform her tongue,—the swan's 1650
       down-feather,
       That stands upon the swell at full of tide,
       And neither way inclines.

     * Domitius Enobarus. [Aside to AGRIPPA] Will Caesar weep?

     * Agrippa. [Aside to DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS] He has a cloud in 's face.
       1655

     * Domitius Enobarus. [Aside to AGRIPPA] He were the worse for that,
       were he a horse;
       So is he, being a man.

     * Agrippa. [Aside to DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS] Why, Enobarbus,
       When Antony found Julius Caesar dead, 1660
       He cried almost to roaring; and he wept
       When at Philippi he found Brutus slain.

     * Domitius Enobarus. [Aside to AGRIPPA] That year, indeed, he was
       troubled with a rheum;
       What willingly he did confound he wail'd, 1665
       Believe't, till I wept too.

     * Octavius. No, sweet Octavia,
       You shall hear from me still; the time shall not
       Out-go my thinking on you.

     * Antony. Come, sir, come; 1670
       I'll wrestle with you in my strength of love:
       Look, here I have you; thus I let you go,
       And give you to the gods.

     * Octavius. Adieu; be happy!

     * Lepidus. Let all the number of the stars give light 1675
       To thy fair way!

     * Octavius. Farewell, farewell!

   [Kisses OCTAVIA]
     * Antony. Farewell!

   Act III, Scene 3

   Alexandria. CLEOPATRA’s palace.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   [Enter CLEOPATRA, CHARMIAN, IRAS, and ALEXAS]
     * Cleopatra. Where is the fellow?

     * Alexas. Half afeard to come.

     * Cleopatra. Go to, go to.
       [Enter the Messenger as before] 1685
       Come hither, sir.

     * Alexas. Good majesty,
       Herod of Jewry dare not look upon you
       But when you are well pleased.

     * Cleopatra. That Herod's head 1690
       I'll have: but how, when Antony is gone
       Through whom I might command it? Come thou near.

     * Messenger. Most gracious majesty,—

     * Cleopatra. Didst thou behold Octavia?

     * Messenger. Ay, dread queen. 1695

     * Cleopatra. Where?

     * Messenger. Madam, in Rome;
       I look'd her in the face, and saw her led
       Between her brother and Mark Antony.

     * Cleopatra. Is she as tall as me? 1700

     * Messenger. She is not, madam.

     * Cleopatra. Didst hear her speak? is she shrill-tongued or low?

     * Messenger. Madam, I heard her speak; she is low-voiced.

     * Cleopatra. That's not so good: he cannot like her long.

     * Charmian. Like her! O Isis! 'tis impossible. 1705

     * Cleopatra. I think so, Charmian: dull of tongue, and dwarfish!
       What majesty is in her gait? Remember,
       If e'er thou look'dst on majesty.

     * Messenger. She creeps:
       Her motion and her station are as one; 1710
       She shows a body rather than a life,
       A statue than a breather.

     * Cleopatra. Is this certain?

     * Messenger. Or I have no observance.

     * Charmian. Three in Egypt 1715
       Cannot make better note.

     * Cleopatra. He's very knowing;
       I do perceive't: there's nothing in her yet:
       The fellow has good judgment.

     * Charmian. Excellent. 1720

     * Cleopatra. Guess at her years, I prithee.

     * Messenger. Madam,
       She was a widow,—

     * Cleopatra. Widow! Charmian, hark.

     * Messenger. And I do think she's thirty. 1725

     * Cleopatra. Bear'st thou her face in mind? is't long or round?

     * Messenger. Round even to faultiness.

     * Cleopatra. For the most part, too, they are foolish that are so.
       Her hair, what colour?

     * Messenger. Brown, madam: and her forehead 1730
       As low as she would wish it.

     * Cleopatra. There's gold for thee.
       Thou must not take my former sharpness ill:
       I will employ thee back again; I find thee
       Most fit for business: go make thee ready; 1735
       Our letters are prepared.

   [Exit Messenger]
     * Charmian. A proper man.

     * Cleopatra. Indeed, he is so: I repent me much
       That so I harried him. Why, methinks, by him, 1740
       This creature's no such thing.

     * Charmian. Nothing, madam.

     * Cleopatra. The man hath seen some majesty, and should know.

     * Charmian. Hath he seen majesty? Isis else defend,
       And serving you so long! 1745

     * Cleopatra. I have one thing more to ask him yet, good Charmian:
       But 'tis no matter; thou shalt bring him to me
       Where I will write. All may be well enough.

     * Charmian. I warrant you, madam.

   [Exeunt]

   Act III, Scene 4

   Athens. A room in MARK ANTONY’s house.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   [Enter MARK ANTONY and OCTAVIA]
     * Antony. Nay, nay, Octavia, not only that,—
       That were excusable, that, and thousands more
       Of semblable import,—but he hath waged
       New wars 'gainst Pompey; made his will, and read it 1755
       To public ear:
       Spoke scantly of me: when perforce he could not
       But pay me terms of honour, cold and sickly
       He vented them; most narrow measure lent me:
       When the best hint was given him, he not took't, 1760
       Or did it from his teeth.

     * Octavia. O my good lord,
       Believe not all; or, if you must believe,
       Stomach not all. A more unhappy lady,
       If this division chance, ne'er stood between, 1765
       Praying for both parts:
       The good gods me presently,
       When I shall pray, 'O bless my lord and husband!'
       Undo that prayer, by crying out as loud,
       'O, bless my brother!' Husband win, win brother, 1770
       Prays, and destroys the prayer; no midway
       'Twixt these extremes at all.

     * Antony. Gentle Octavia,
       Let your best love draw to that point, which seeks
       Best to preserve it: if I lose mine honour, 1775
       I lose myself: better I were not yours
       Than yours so branchless. But, as you requested,
       Yourself shall go between 's: the mean time, lady,
       I'll raise the preparation of a war
       Shall stain your brother: make your soonest haste; 1780
       So your desires are yours.

     * Octavia. Thanks to my lord.
       The Jove of power make me most weak, most weak,
       Your reconciler! Wars 'twixt you twain would be
       As if the world should cleave, and that slain men 1785
       Should solder up the rift.

     * Antony. When it appears to you where this begins,
       Turn your displeasure that way: for our faults
       Can never be so equal, that your love
       Can equally move with them. Provide your going; 1790
       Choose your own company, and command what cost
       Your heart has mind to.

   [Exeunt]

   Act III, Scene 5

   The same. Another room.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   [Enter DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS and EROS, meeting]
     * Domitius Enobarus. How now, friend Eros! 1795

     * Eros. There's strange news come, sir.

     * Domitius Enobarus. What, man?

     * Eros. Caesar and Lepidus have made wars upon Pompey.

     * Domitius Enobarus. This is old: what is the success?

     * Eros. Caesar, having made use of him in the wars 'gainst 1800
       Pompey, presently denied him rivality; would not let
       him partake in the glory of the action: and not
       resting here, accuses him of letters he had formerly
       wrote to Pompey; upon his own appeal, seizes him: so
       the poor third is up, till death enlarge his confine. 1805

     * Domitius Enobarus. Then, world, thou hast a pair of chaps, no more;
       And throw between them all the food thou hast,
       They'll grind the one the other. Where's Antony?

     * Eros. He's walking in the garden—thus; and spurns
       The rush that lies before him; cries, 'Fool Lepidus!' 1810
       And threats the throat of that his officer
       That murder'd Pompey.

     * Domitius Enobarus. Our great navy's rigg'd.

     * Eros. For Italy and Caesar. More, Domitius;
       My lord desires you presently: my news 1815
       I might have told hereafter.

     * Domitius Enobarus. 'Twill be naught:
       But let it be. Bring me to Antony.

     * Eros. Come, sir.

   [Exeunt]

   Act III, Scene 6

   Rome. OCTAVIUS CAESAR’s house.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   [Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR, AGRIPPA, and MECAENAS]
     * Octavius. Contemning Rome, he has done all this, and more,
       In Alexandria: here's the manner of 't:
       I' the market-place, on a tribunal silver'd,
       Cleopatra and himself in chairs of gold 1825
       Were publicly enthroned: at the feet sat
       Caesarion, whom they call my father's son,
       And all the unlawful issue that their lust
       Since then hath made between them. Unto her
       He gave the stablishment of Egypt; made her 1830
       Of lower Syria, Cyprus, Lydia,
       Absolute queen.

     * Mecaenas. This in the public eye?

     * Octavius. I' the common show-place, where they exercise.
       His sons he there proclaim'd the kings of kings: 1835
       Great Media, Parthia, and Armenia.
       He gave to Alexander; to Ptolemy he assign'd
       Syria, Cilicia, and Phoenicia: she
       In the habiliments of the goddess Isis
       That day appear'd; and oft before gave audience, 1840
       As 'tis reported, so.

     * Mecaenas. Let Rome be thus Inform'd.

     * Agrippa. Who, queasy with his insolence
       Already, will their good thoughts call from him.

     * Octavius. The people know it; and have now received 1845
       His accusations.

     * Agrippa. Who does he accuse?

     * Octavius. Caesar: and that, having in Sicily
       Sextus Pompeius spoil'd, we had not rated him
       His part o' the isle: then does he say, he lent me 1850
       Some shipping unrestored: lastly, he frets
       That Lepidus of the triumvirate
       Should be deposed; and, being, that we detain
       All his revenue.

     * Agrippa. Sir, this should be answer'd. 1855

     * Octavius. 'Tis done already, and the messenger gone.
       I have told him, Lepidus was grown too cruel;
       That he his high authority abused,
       And did deserve his change: for what I have conquer'd,
       I grant him part; but then, in his Armenia, 1860
       And other of his conquer'd kingdoms, I
       Demand the like.

     * Mecaenas. He'll never yield to that.

     * Octavius. Nor must not then be yielded to in this.

   [Enter OCTAVIA with her train]
     * Octavia. Hail, Caesar, and my lord! hail, most dear Caesar!

     * Octavius. That ever I should call thee castaway!

     * Octavia. You have not call'd me so, nor have you cause.

     * Octavius. Why have you stol'n upon us thus! You come not
       Like Caesar's sister: the wife of Antony 1870
       Should have an army for an usher, and
       The neighs of horse to tell of her approach
       Long ere she did appear; the trees by the way
       Should have borne men; and expectation fainted,
       Longing for what it had not; nay, the dust 1875
       Should have ascended to the roof of heaven,
       Raised by your populous troops: but you are come
       A market-maid to Rome; and have prevented
       The ostentation of our love, which, left unshown,
       Is often left unloved; we should have met you 1880
       By sea and land; supplying every stage
       With an augmented greeting.

     * Octavia. Good my lord,
       To come thus was I not constrain'd, but did
       On my free will. My lord, Mark Antony, 1885
       Hearing that you prepared for war, acquainted
       My grieved ear withal; whereon, I begg'd
       His pardon for return.

     * Octavius. Which soon he granted,
       Being an obstruct 'tween his lust and him. 1890

     * Octavia. Do not say so, my lord.

     * Octavius. I have eyes upon him,
       And his affairs come to me on the wind.
       Where is he now?

     * Octavia. My lord, in Athens. 1895

     * Octavius. No, my most wronged sister; Cleopatra
       Hath nodded him to her. He hath given his empire
       Up to a whore; who now are levying
       The kings o' the earth for war; he hath assembled
       Bocchus, the king of Libya; Archelaus, 1900
       Of Cappadocia; Philadelphos, king
       Of Paphlagonia; the Thracian king, Adallas;
       King Malchus of Arabia; King of Pont;
       Herod of Jewry; Mithridates, king
       Of Comagene; Polemon and Amyntas, 1905
       The kings of Mede and Lycaonia,
       With a more larger list of sceptres.

     * Octavia. Ay me, most wretched,
       That have my heart parted betwixt two friends
       That do afflict each other! 1910

     * Octavius. Welcome hither:
       Your letters did withhold our breaking forth;
       Till we perceived, both how you were wrong led,
       And we in negligent danger. Cheer your heart;
       Be you not troubled with the time, which drives 1915
       O'er your content these strong necessities;
       But let determined things to destiny
       Hold unbewail'd their way. Welcome to Rome;
       Nothing more dear to me. You are abused
       Beyond the mark of thought: and the high gods, 1920
       To do you justice, make them ministers
       Of us and those that love you. Best of comfort;
       And ever welcome to us.

     * Agrippa. Welcome, lady.

     * Mecaenas. Welcome, dear madam. 1925
       Each heart in Rome does love and pity you:
       Only the adulterous Antony, most large
       In his abominations, turns you off;
       And gives his potent regiment to a trull,
       That noises it against us. 1930

     * Octavia. Is it so, sir?

     * Octavius. Most certain. Sister, welcome: pray you,
       Be ever known to patience: my dear'st sister!

   [Exeunt]

   Act III, Scene 7

   Near Actium. MARK ANTONY’s camp.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   [Enter CLEOPATRA and DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS]
     * Cleopatra. I will be even with thee, doubt it not.

     * Domitius Enobarus. But why, why, why?

     * Cleopatra. Thou hast forspoke my being in these wars,
       And say'st it is not fit.

     * Domitius Enobarus. Well, is it, is it? 1940

     * Cleopatra. If not denounced against us, why should not we
       Be there in person?

     * Domitius Enobarus. [Aside] Well, I could reply:
       If we should serve with horse and mares together,
       The horse were merely lost; the mares would bear 1945
       A soldier and his horse.

     * Cleopatra. What is't you say?

     * Domitius Enobarus. Your presence needs must puzzle Antony;
       Take from his heart, take from his brain,
       from's time, 1950
       What should not then be spared. He is already
       Traduced for levity; and 'tis said in Rome
       That Photinus an eunuch and your maids
       Manage this war.

     * Cleopatra. Sink Rome, and their tongues rot 1955
       That speak against us! A charge we bear i' the war,
       And, as the president of my kingdom, will
       Appear there for a man. Speak not against it:
       I will not stay behind.

     * Domitius Enobarus. Nay, I have done. 1960
       Here comes the emperor.

   [Enter MARK ANTONY and CANIDIUS]
     * Antony. Is it not strange, Canidius,
       That from Tarentum and Brundusium
       He could so quickly cut the Ionian sea, 1965
       And take in Toryne? You have heard on't, sweet?

     * Cleopatra. Celerity is never more admired
       Than by the negligent.

     * Antony. A good rebuke,
       Which might have well becomed the best of men, 1970
       To taunt at slackness. Canidius, we
       Will fight with him by sea.

     * Cleopatra. By sea! what else?

     * Canidius. Why will my lord do so?

     * Antony. For that he dares us to't. 1975

     * Domitius Enobarus. So hath my lord dared him to single fight.

     * Canidius. Ay, and to wage this battle at Pharsalia.
       Where Caesar fought with Pompey: but these offers,
       Which serve not for his vantage, be shakes off;
       And so should you. 1980

     * Domitius Enobarus. Your ships are not well mann'd;
       Your mariners are muleters, reapers, people
       Ingross'd by swift impress; in Caesar's fleet
       Are those that often have 'gainst Pompey fought:
       Their ships are yare; yours, heavy: no disgrace 1985
       Shall fall you for refusing him at sea,
       Being prepared for land.

     * Antony. By sea, by sea.

     * Domitius Enobarus. Most worthy sir, you therein throw away
       The absolute soldiership you have by land; 1990
       Distract your army, which doth most consist
       Of war-mark'd footmen; leave unexecuted
       Your own renowned knowledge; quite forego
       The way which promises assurance; and
       Give up yourself merely to chance and hazard, 1995
       From firm security.

     * Antony. I'll fight at sea.

     * Cleopatra. I have sixty sails, Caesar none better.

     * Antony. Our overplus of shipping will we burn;
       And, with the rest full-mann'd, from the head of Actium 2000
       Beat the approaching Caesar. But if we fail,
       We then can do't at land.
       [Enter a Messenger]
       Thy business?

     * Messenger. The news is true, my lord; he is descried; 2005
       Caesar has taken Toryne.

     * Antony. Can he be there in person? 'tis impossible;
       Strange that power should be. Canidius,
       Our nineteen legions thou shalt hold by land,
       And our twelve thousand horse. We'll to our ship: 2010
       Away, my Thetis!
       [Enter a Soldier]
       How now, worthy soldier?

     * Soldier. O noble emperor, do not fight by sea;
       Trust not to rotten planks: do you misdoubt 2015
       This sword and these my wounds? Let the Egyptians
       And the Phoenicians go a-ducking; we
       Have used to conquer, standing on the earth,
       And fighting foot to foot.

     * Antony. Well, well: away! 2020

   [Exeunt MARK ANTONY, QUEEN CLEOPATRA, and DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS]
     * Soldier. By Hercules, I think I am i' the right.

     * Canidius. Soldier, thou art: but his whole action grows
       Not in the power on't: so our leader's led,
       And we are women's men. 2025

     * Soldier. You keep by land
       The legions and the horse whole, do you not?

     * Canidius. Marcus Octavius, Marcus Justeius,
       Publicola, and Caelius, are for sea:
       But we keep whole by land. This speed of Caesar's 2030
       Carries beyond belief.

     * Soldier. While he was yet in Rome,
       His power went out in such distractions as
       Beguiled all spies.

     * Canidius. Who's his lieutenant, hear you? 2035

     * Soldier. They say, one Taurus.

     * Canidius. Well I know the man.

   [Enter a Messenger]
     * Messenger. The emperor calls Canidius.

     * Canidius. With news the time's with labour, and throes forth, 2040
       Each minute, some.

   [Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR, and TAURUS, with his army, marching]
     * Octavius. Taurus!

     * Taurus. My lord? 2045

     * Octavius. Strike not by land; keep whole: provoke not battle,
       Till we have done at sea. Do not exceed
       The prescript of this scroll: our fortune lies

   [CANIDIUS marcheth with his land army one way over] [p]the stage; and
   TAURUS, the lieutenant of OCTAVIUS [p]CAESAR, the other way. After
   their going in, is [p]heard the noise of a sea-fight]

   [Alarum. Enter DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS]
     * Domitius Enobarus. Naught, naught all, naught! I can behold no
       longer:
       The Antoniad, the Egyptian admiral,
       With all their sixty, fly and turn the rudder:
       To see't mine eyes are blasted. 2065

   [Enter SCARUS]
     * Scarus. Gods and goddesses,
       All the whole synod of them!

     * Domitius Enobarus. What's thy passion!

     * Scarus. The greater cantle of the world is lost 2070
       With very ignorance; we have kiss'd away
       Kingdoms and provinces.

     * Domitius Enobarus. How appears the fight?

     * Scarus. On our side like the token'd pestilence,
       Where death is sure. Yon ribaudred nag of Egypt,— 2075
       Whom leprosy o'ertake!—i' the midst o' the fight,
       When vantage like a pair of twins appear'd,
       Both as the same, or rather ours the elder,
       The breese upon her, like a cow in June,
       Hoists sails and flies. 2080

     * Domitius Enobarus. That I beheld:
       Mine eyes did sicken at the sight, and could not
       Endure a further view.

     * Scarus. She once being loof'd,
       The noble ruin of her magic, Antony, 2085
       Claps on his sea-wing, and, like a doting mallard,
       Leaving the fight in height, flies after her:
       I never saw an action of such shame;
       Experience, manhood, honour, ne'er before
       Did violate so itself. 2090

     * Domitius Enobarus. Alack, alack!

   [Enter CANIDIUS]
     * Canidius. Our fortune on the sea is out of breath,
       And sinks most lamentably. Had our general
       Been what he knew himself, it had gone well: 2095
       O, he has given example for our flight,
       Most grossly, by his own!

     * Domitius Enobarus. Ay, are you thereabouts?
       Why, then, good night indeed.

     * Canidius. Toward Peloponnesus are they fled. 2100

     * Scarus. 'Tis easy to't; and there I will attend
       What further comes.

     * Canidius. To Caesar will I render
       My legions and my horse: six kings already
       Show me the way of yielding. 2105

     * Domitius Enobarus. I'll yet follow
       The wounded chance of Antony, though my reason
       Sits in the wind against me.

   Act III, Scene 11

   Alexandria. CLEOPATRA’s palace.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   [Enter MARK ANTONY with Attendants]
     * Antony. Hark! the land bids me tread no more upon't;
       It is ashamed to bear me! Friends, come hither:
       I am so lated in the world, that I
       Have lost my way for ever: I have a ship
       Laden with gold; take that, divide it; fly, 2115
       And make your peace with Caesar.

     * All. Fly! not we.

     * Antony. I have fled myself; and have instructed cowards
       To run and show their shoulders. Friends, be gone;
       I have myself resolved upon a course 2120
       Which has no need of you; be gone:
       My treasure's in the harbour, take it. O,
       I follow'd that I blush to look upon:
       My very hairs do mutiny; for the white
       Reprove the brown for rashness, and they them 2125
       For fear and doting. Friends, be gone: you shall
       Have letters from me to some friends that will
       Sweep your way for you. Pray you, look not sad,
       Nor make replies of loathness: take the hint
       Which my despair proclaims; let that be left 2130
       Which leaves itself: to the sea-side straightway:
       I will possess you of that ship and treasure.
       Leave me, I pray, a little: pray you now:
       Nay, do so; for, indeed, I have lost command,
       Therefore I pray you: I'll see you by and by. 2135
       [Sits down]
       [Enter CLEOPATRA led by CHARMIAN and IRAS; EROS]
       following]

     * Eros. Nay, gentle madam, to him, comfort him.

     * Iras. Do, most dear queen. 2140

     * Charmian. Do! why: what else?

     * Cleopatra. Let me sit down. O Juno!

     * Antony. No, no, no, no, no.

     * Eros. See you here, sir?

     * Antony. O fie, fie, fie! 2145

     * Charmian. Madam!

     * Iras. Madam, O good empress!

     * Eros. Sir, sir,—

     * Antony. Yes, my lord, yes; he at Philippi kept
       His sword e'en like a dancer; while I struck 2150
       The lean and wrinkled Cassius; and 'twas I
       That the mad Brutus ended: he alone
       Dealt on lieutenantry, and no practise had
       In the brave squares of war: yet now—No matter.

     * Cleopatra. Ah, stand by. 2155

     * Eros. The queen, my lord, the queen.

     * Iras. Go to him, madam, speak to him:
       He is unqualitied with very shame.

     * Cleopatra. Well then, sustain him: O!

     * Eros. Most noble sir, arise; the queen approaches: 2160
       Her head's declined, and death will seize her, but
       Your comfort makes the rescue.

     * Antony. I have offended reputation,
       A most unnoble swerving.

     * Eros. Sir, the queen. 2165

     * Antony. O, whither hast thou led me, Egypt? See,
       How I convey my shame out of thine eyes
       By looking back what I have left behind
       'Stroy'd in dishonour.

     * Cleopatra. O my lord, my lord, 2170
       Forgive my fearful sails! I little thought
       You would have follow'd.

     * Antony. Egypt, thou knew'st too well
       My heart was to thy rudder tied by the strings,
       And thou shouldst tow me after: o'er my spirit 2175
       Thy full supremacy thou knew'st, and that
       Thy beck might from the bidding of the gods
       Command me.

     * Cleopatra. O, my pardon!

     * Antony. Now I must 2180
       To the young man send humble treaties, dodge
       And palter in the shifts of lowness; who
       With half the bulk o' the world play'd as I pleased,
       Making and marring fortunes. You did know
       How much you were my conqueror; and that 2185
       My sword, made weak by my affection, would
       Obey it on all cause.

     * Cleopatra. Pardon, pardon!

     * Antony. Fall not a tear, I say; one of them rates
       All that is won and lost: give me a kiss; 2190
       Even this repays me. We sent our schoolmaster;
       Is he come back? Love, I am full of lead.
       Some wine, within there, and our viands! Fortune knows
       We scorn her most when most she offers blows.

   Act III, Scene 12

   Egypt. OCTAVIUS CAESAR’s camp.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   [Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR, DOLABELLA, THYREUS, with others]
     * Octavius. Let him appear that's come from Antony.
       Know you him?

     * Dolabella. Caesar, 'tis his schoolmaster:
       An argument that he is pluck'd, when hither 2200
       He sends so poor a pinion off his wing,
       Which had superfluous kings for messengers
       Not many moons gone by.

   [Enter EUPHRONIUS, ambassador from MARK ANTONY]
     * Octavius. Approach, and speak. 2205

     * Euphronius. Such as I am, I come from Antony:
       I was of late as petty to his ends
       As is the morn-dew on the myrtle-leaf
       To his grand sea.

     * Octavius. Be't so: declare thine office. 2210

     * Euphronius. Lord of his fortunes he salutes thee, and
       Requires to live in Egypt: which not granted,
       He lessens his requests; and to thee sues
       To let him breathe between the heavens and earth,
       A private man in Athens: this for him. 2215
       Next, Cleopatra does confess thy greatness;
       Submits her to thy might; and of thee craves
       The circle of the Ptolemies for her heirs,
       Now hazarded to thy grace.

     * Octavius. For Antony, 2220
       I have no ears to his request. The queen
       Of audience nor desire shall fail, so she
       From Egypt drive her all-disgraced friend,
       Or take his life there: this if she perform,
       She shall not sue unheard. So to them both. 2225

     * Euphronius. Fortune pursue thee!

     * Octavius. Bring him through the bands.
       [Exit EUPHRONIUS]
       [To THYREUS] To try eloquence, now 'tis time: dispatch;]
       From Antony win Cleopatra: promise, 2230
       And in our name, what she requires; add more,
       From thine invention, offers: women are not
       In their best fortunes strong; but want will perjure
       The ne'er touch'd vestal: try thy cunning, Thyreus;
       Make thine own edict for thy pains, which we 2235
       Will answer as a law.

     * Thyreus. Caesar, I go.

     * Octavius. Observe how Antony becomes his flaw,
       And what thou think'st his very action speaks
       In every power that moves. 2240

     * Thyreus. Caesar, I shall.

   [Exeunt]

   Act III, Scene 13

   Alexandria. CLEOPATRA’s palace.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   [Enter CLEOPATRA, DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS, CHARMIAN, and IRAS]
     * Cleopatra. What shall we do, Enobarbus?

     * Domitius Enobarus. Think, and die. 2245

     * Cleopatra. Is Antony or we in fault for this?

     * Domitius Enobarus. Antony only, that would make his will
       Lord of his reason. What though you fled
       From that great face of war, whose several ranges
       Frighted each other? why should he follow? 2250
       The itch of his affection should not then
       Have nick'd his captainship; at such a point,
       When half to half the world opposed, he being
       The meered question: 'twas a shame no less
       Than was his loss, to course your flying flags, 2255
       And leave his navy gazing.

     * Cleopatra. Prithee, peace.

   [Enter MARK ANTONY with EUPHRONIUS, the Ambassador]
     * Antony. Is that his answer?

     * Euphronius. Ay, my lord. 2260

     * Antony. The queen shall then have courtesy, so she
       Will yield us up.

     * Euphronius. He says so.

     * Antony. Let her know't.
       To the boy Caesar send this grizzled head, 2265
       And he will fill thy wishes to the brim
       With principalities.

     * Cleopatra. That head, my lord?

     * Antony. To him again: tell him he wears the rose
       Of youth upon him; from which the world should note 2270
       Something particular: his coin, ships, legions,
       May be a coward's; whose ministers would prevail
       Under the service of a child as soon
       As i' the command of Caesar: I dare him therefore
       To lay his gay comparisons apart, 2275
       And answer me declined, sword against sword,
       Ourselves alone. I'll write it: follow me.

   [Exeunt MARK ANTONY and EUPHRONIUS]
     * Domitius Enobarus. [Aside] Yes, like enough, high-battled Caesar
       will
       Unstate his happiness, and be staged to the show, 2280
       Against a sworder! I see men's judgments are
       A parcel of their fortunes; and things outward
       Do draw the inward quality after them,
       To suffer all alike. That he should dream,
       Knowing all measures, the full Caesar will 2285
       Answer his emptiness! Caesar, thou hast subdued
       His judgment too.

   [Enter an Attendant]
     * Attendant. A messenger from CAESAR.

     * Cleopatra. What, no more ceremony? See, my women! 2290
       Against the blown rose may they stop their nose
       That kneel'd unto the buds. Admit him, sir.

   [Exit Attendant]
     * Domitius Enobarus. [Aside] Mine honesty and I begin to square.
       The loyalty well held to fools does make 2295
       Our faith mere folly: yet he that can endure
       To follow with allegiance a fall'n lord
       Does conquer him that did his master conquer
       And earns a place i' the story.

   [Enter THYREUS]
     * Cleopatra. Caesar's will?

     * Thyreus. Hear it apart.

     * Cleopatra. None but friends: say boldly.

     * Thyreus. So, haply, are they friends to Antony.

     * Domitius Enobarus. He needs as many, sir, as Caesar has; 2305
       Or needs not us. If Caesar please, our master
       Will leap to be his friend: for us, you know,
       Whose he is we are, and that is, Caesar's.

     * Thyreus. So.
       Thus then, thou most renown'd: Caesar entreats, 2310
       Not to consider in what case thou stand'st,
       Further than he is Caesar.

     * Cleopatra. Go on: right royal.

     * Thyreus. He knows that you embrace not Antony
       As you did love, but as you fear'd him. 2315

     * Cleopatra. O!

     * Thyreus. The scars upon your honour, therefore, he
       Does pity, as constrained blemishes,
       Not as deserved.

     * Cleopatra. He is a god, and knows 2320
       What is most right: mine honour was not yielded,
       But conquer'd merely.

     * Domitius Enobarus. [Aside] To be sure of that,
       I will ask Antony. Sir, sir, thou art so leaky,
       That we must leave thee to thy sinking, for 2325
       Thy dearest quit thee.

   [Exit]
     * Thyreus. Shall I say to Caesar
       What you require of him? for he partly begs
       To be desired to give. It much would please him, 2330
       That of his fortunes you should make a staff
       To lean upon: but it would warm his spirits,
       To hear from me you had left Antony,
       And put yourself under his shrowd,
       The universal landlord. 2335

     * Cleopatra. What's your name?

     * Thyreus. My name is Thyreus.

     * Cleopatra. Most kind messenger,
       Say to great Caesar this: in deputation
       I kiss his conquering hand: tell him, I am prompt 2340
       To lay my crown at 's feet, and there to kneel:
       Tell him from his all-obeying breath I hear
       The doom of Egypt.

     * Thyreus. 'Tis your noblest course.
       Wisdom and fortune combating together, 2345
       If that the former dare but what it can,
       No chance may shake it. Give me grace to lay
       My duty on your hand.

     * Cleopatra. Your Caesar's father oft,
       When he hath mused of taking kingdoms in, 2350
       Bestow'd his lips on that unworthy place,
       As it rain'd kisses.

   [Re-enter MARK ANTONY and DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS]
     * Antony. Favours, by Jove that thunders!
       What art thou, fellow? 2355

     * Thyreus. One that but performs
       The bidding of the fullest man, and worthiest
       To have command obey'd.

     * Domitius Enobarus. [Aside] You will be whipp'd.

     * Antony. Approach, there! Ah, you kite! Now, gods 2360
       and devils!
       Authority melts from me: of late, when I cried 'Ho!'
       Like boys unto a muss, kings would start forth,
       And cry 'Your will?' Have you no ears? I am
       Antony yet. 2365
       [Enter Attendants]
       Take hence this Jack, and whip him.

     * Domitius Enobarus. [Aside] 'Tis better playing with a lion's whelp
       Than with an old one dying.

     * Antony. Moon and stars! 2370
       Whip him. Were't twenty of the greatest tributaries
       That do acknowledge Caesar, should I find them
       So saucy with the hand of she here,—what's her name,
       Since she was Cleopatra? Whip him, fellows,
       Till, like a boy, you see him cringe his face, 2375
       And whine aloud for mercy: take him hence.

     * Thyreus. Mark Antony!

     * Antony. Tug him away: being whipp'd,
       Bring him again: this Jack of Caesar's shall
       Bear us an errand to him. 2380
       [Exeunt Attendants with THYREUS]
       You were half blasted ere I knew you: ha!
       Have I my pillow left unpress'd in Rome,
       Forborne the getting of a lawful race,
       And by a gem of women, to be abused 2385
       By one that looks on feeders?

     * Cleopatra. Good my lord,—

     * Antony. You have been a boggler ever:
       But when we in our viciousness grow hard—
       O misery on't!—the wise gods seel our eyes; 2390
       In our own filth drop our clear judgments; make us
       Adore our errors; laugh at's, while we strut
       To our confusion.

     * Cleopatra. O, is't come to this?

     * Antony. I found you as a morsel cold upon 2395
       Dead Caesar's trencher; nay, you were a fragment
       Of Cneius Pompey's; besides what hotter hours,
       Unregister'd in vulgar fame, you have
       Luxuriously pick'd out: for, I am sure,
       Though you can guess what temperance should be, 2400
       You know not what it is.

     * Cleopatra. Wherefore is this?

     * Antony. To let a fellow that will take rewards
       And say 'God quit you!' be familiar with
       My playfellow, your hand; this kingly seal 2405
       And plighter of high hearts! O, that I were
       Upon the hill of Basan, to outroar
       The horned herd! for I have savage cause;
       And to proclaim it civilly, were like
       A halter'd neck which does the hangman thank 2410
       For being yare about him.
       [Re-enter Attendants with THYREUS]
       Is he whipp'd?

     * First Attendant. Soundly, my lord.

     * Antony. Cried he? and begg'd a' pardon? 2415

     * First Attendant. He did ask favour.

     * Antony. If that thy father live, let him repent
       Thou wast not made his daughter; and be thou sorry
       To follow Caesar in his triumph, since
       Thou hast been whipp'd for following him: henceforth 2420
       The white hand of a lady fever thee,
       Shake thou to look on 't. Get thee back to Caesar,
       Tell him thy entertainment: look, thou say
       He makes me angry with him; for he seems
       Proud and disdainful, harping on what I am, 2425
       Not what he knew I was: he makes me angry;
       And at this time most easy 'tis to do't,
       When my good stars, that were my former guides,
       Have empty left their orbs, and shot their fires
       Into the abysm of hell. If he mislike 2430
       My speech and what is done, tell him he has
       Hipparchus, my enfranched bondman, whom
       He may at pleasure whip, or hang, or torture,
       As he shall like, to quit me: urge it thou:
       Hence with thy stripes, begone! 2435

   [Exit THYREUS]
     * Cleopatra. Have you done yet?

     * Antony. Alack, our terrene moon
       Is now eclipsed; and it portends alone
       The fall of Antony! 2440

     * Cleopatra. I must stay his time.

     * Antony. To flatter Caesar, would you mingle eyes
       With one that ties his points?

     * Cleopatra. Not know me yet?

     * Antony. Cold-hearted toward me? 2445

     * Cleopatra. Ah, dear, if I be so,
       From my cold heart let heaven engender hail,
       And poison it in the source; and the first stone
       Drop in my neck: as it determines, so
       Dissolve my life! The next Caesarion smite! 2450
       Till by degrees the memory of my womb,
       Together with my brave Egyptians all,
       By the discandying of this pelleted storm,
       Lie graveless, till the flies and gnats of Nile
       Have buried them for prey! 2455

     * Antony. I am satisfied.
       Caesar sits down in Alexandria; where
       I will oppose his fate. Our force by land
       Hath nobly held; our sever'd navy too
       Have knit again, and fleet, threatening most sea-like. 2460
       Where hast thou been, my heart? Dost thou hear, lady?
       If from the field I shall return once more
       To kiss these lips, I will appear in blood;
       I and my sword will earn our chronicle:
       There's hope in't yet. 2465

     * Cleopatra. That's my brave lord!

     * Antony. I will be treble-sinew'd, hearted, breathed,
       And fight maliciously: for when mine hours
       Were nice and lucky, men did ransom lives
       Of me for jests; but now I'll set my teeth, 2470
       And send to darkness all that stop me. Come,
       Let's have one other gaudy night: call to me
       All my sad captains; fill our bowls once more;
       Let's mock the midnight bell.

     * Cleopatra. It is my birth-day: 2475
       I had thought to have held it poor: but, since my lord
       Is Antony again, I will be Cleopatra.

     * Antony. We will yet do well.

     * Cleopatra. Call all his noble captains to my lord.

     * Antony. Do so, we'll speak to them; and to-night I'll force 2480
       The wine peep through their scars. Come on, my queen;
       There's sap in't yet. The next time I do fight,
       I'll make death love me; for I will contend
       Even with his pestilent scythe.

   [Exeunt all but DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS]
     * Domitius Enobarus. Now he'll outstare the lightning. To be furious,
       Is to be frighted out of fear; and in that mood
       The dove will peck the estridge; and I see still,
       A diminution in our captain's brain
       Restores his heart: when valour preys on reason, 2490
       It eats the sword it fights with. I will seek
       Some way to leave him.

   [Exit]

   _______________________________________________________________________

   [Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR, AGRIPPA, and MECAENAS, with] [p]his Army;
   OCTAVIUS CAESAR reading a letter]
     * Octavius. He calls me boy; and chides, as he had power
       To beat me out of Egypt; my messenger
       He hath whipp'd with rods; dares me to personal combat,
       Caesar to Antony: let the old ruffian know
       I have many other ways to die; meantime 2500
       Laugh at his challenge.

     * Mecaenas. Caesar must think,
       When one so great begins to rage, he's hunted
       Even to falling. Give him no breath, but now
       Make boot of his distraction: never anger 2505
       Made good guard for itself.

     * Octavius. Let our best heads
       Know, that to-morrow the last of many battles
       We mean to fight: within our files there are,
       Of those that served Mark Antony but late, 2510
       Enough to fetch him in. See it done:
       And feast the army; we have store to do't,
       And they have earn'd the waste. Poor Antony!

   Alexandria. CLEOPATRA’s palace.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   [Enter MARK ANTONY, CLEOPATRA, DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,] [p]CHARMIAN, IRAS,
   ALEXAS, with others]
     * Antony. He will not fight with me, Domitius.

     * Domitius Enobarus. No.

     * Antony. Why should he not?

     * Domitius Enobarus. He thinks, being twenty times of better fortune,
       2520
       He is twenty men to one.

     * Antony. To-morrow, soldier,
       By sea and land I'll fight: or I will live,
       Or bathe my dying honour in the blood
       Shall make it live again. Woo't thou fight well? 2525

     * Domitius Enobarus. I'll strike, and cry 'Take all.'

     * Antony. Well said; come on.
       Call forth my household servants: let's to-night
       Be bounteous at our meal.
       [Enter three or four Servitors] 2530
       Give me thy hand,
       Thou hast been rightly honest;—so hast thou;—
       Thou,—and thou,—and thou:—you have served me well,
       And kings have been your fellows.

     * Cleopatra. [Aside to DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS] What means this? 2535

     * Domitius Enobarus. [Aside to CLEOPATRA] 'Tis one of those odd
       tricks which sorrow shoots
       Out of the mind.

     * Antony. And thou art honest too.
       I wish I could be made so many men, 2540
       And all of you clapp'd up together in
       An Antony, that I might do you service
       So good as you have done.

     * All. The gods forbid!

     * Antony. Well, my good fellows, wait on me to-night: 2545
       Scant not my cups; and make as much of me
       As when mine empire was your fellow too,
       And suffer'd my command.

     * Cleopatra. [Aside to DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS] What does he mean?

     * Domitius Enobarus. [Aside to CLEOPATRA] To make his followers weep.
       2550

     * Antony. Tend me to-night;
       May be it is the period of your duty:
       Haply you shall not see me more; or if,
       A mangled shadow: perchance to-morrow
       You'll serve another master. I look on you 2555
       As one that takes his leave. Mine honest friends,
       I turn you not away; but, like a master
       Married to your good service, stay till death:
       Tend me to-night two hours, I ask no more,
       And the gods yield you for't! 2560

     * Domitius Enobarus. What mean you, sir,
       To give them this discomfort? Look, they weep;
       And I, an ass, am onion-eyed: for shame,
       Transform us not to women.

     * Antony. Ho, ho, ho! 2565
       Now the witch take me, if I meant it thus!
       Grace grow where those drops fall!
       My hearty friends,
       You take me in too dolorous a sense;
       For I spake to you for your comfort; did desire you 2570
       To burn this night with torches: know, my hearts,
       I hope well of to-morrow; and will lead you
       Where rather I'll expect victorious life
       Than death and honour. Let's to supper, come,
       And drown consideration. 2575

   [Enter two Soldiers to their guard]
     * First Soldier. Brother, good night: to-morrow is the day.

     * Second Soldier. It will determine one way: fare you well.
       Heard you of nothing strange about the streets? 2580

     * First Soldier. Nothing. What news?

     * Second Soldier. Belike 'tis but a rumour. Good night to you.

     * First Soldier. Well, sir, good night.

   [Enter two other Soldiers]
     * Second Soldier. Soldiers, have careful watch. 2585

     * Third Soldier. And you. Good night, good night.

   [They place themselves in every corner of the stage]
     * Fourth Soldier. Here we: and if to-morrow
       Our navy thrive, I have an absolute hope
       Our landmen will stand up. 2590

     * Third Soldier. 'Tis a brave army,
       And full of purpose.

   [Music of the hautboys as under the stage]
     * Fourth Soldier. Peace! what noise?

     * First Soldier. List, list! 2595

     * Second Soldier. Hark!

     * First Soldier. Music i' the air.

     * Third Soldier. Under the earth.

     * Fourth Soldier. It signs well, does it not?

     * Third Soldier. No. 2600

     * First Soldier. Peace, I say!
       What should this mean?

     * Second Soldier. 'Tis the god Hercules, whom Antony loved,
       Now leaves him.

     * First Soldier. Walk; let's see if other watchmen 2605
       Do hear what we do?

   [They advance to another post]
     * Second Soldier. How now, masters!

     * All. [Speaking together] How now!
       How now! do you hear this? 2610

     * First Soldier. Ay; is't not strange?

     * Third Soldier. Do you hear, masters? do you hear?

     * First Soldier. Follow the noise so far as we have quarter;
       Let's see how it will give off.

     * All. Content. 'Tis strange. 2615

       [Enter EROS with armour]
       Come good fellow, put mine iron on:
       If fortune be not ours to-day, it is
       Because we brave her: come. 2625

     * Cleopatra. Nay, I'll help too.
       What's this for?

     * Antony. Ah, let be, let be! thou art
       The armourer of my heart: false, false; this, this.

     * Cleopatra. Sooth, la, I'll help: thus it must be. 2630

     * Antony. Well, well;
       We shall thrive now. Seest thou, my good fellow?
       Go put on thy defences.

     * Eros. Briefly, sir.

     * Cleopatra. Is not this buckled well? 2635

     * Antony. Rarely, rarely:
       He that unbuckles this, till we do please
       To daff't for our repose, shall hear a storm.
       Thou fumblest, Eros; and my queen's a squire
       More tight at this than thou: dispatch. O love, 2640
       That thou couldst see my wars to-day, and knew'st
       The royal occupation! thou shouldst see
       A workman in't.
       [Enter an armed Soldier]
       Good morrow to thee; welcome: 2645
       Thou look'st like him that knows a warlike charge:
       To business that we love we rise betime,
       And go to't with delight.

     * Soldier. A thousand, sir,
       Early though't be, have on their riveted trim, 2650
       And at the port expect you.

   [Shout. Trumpets flourish]

   [Enter Captains and Soldiers]
     * Captain. The morn is fair. Good morrow, general.

     * All. Good morrow, general. 2655

     * Antony. 'Tis well blown, lads:
       This morning, like the spirit of a youth
       That means to be of note, begins betimes.
       So, so; come, give me that: this way; well said.
       Fare thee well, dame, whate'er becomes of me: 2660
       This is a soldier's kiss: rebukeable
       [Kisses her]
       And worthy shameful cheque it were, to stand
       On more mechanic compliment; I'll leave thee
       Now, like a man of steel. You that will fight, 2665
       Follow me close; I'll bring you to't. Adieu.

   [Exeunt MARK ANTONY, EROS, Captains, and Soldiers]
     * Charmian. Please you, retire to your chamber.

     * Cleopatra. Lead me.
       He goes forth gallantly. That he and Caesar might 2670

     * Soldier. The gods make this a happy day to Antony!

     * Antony. Would thou and those thy scars had once prevail'd
       To make me fight at land!

     * Soldier. Hadst thou done so,
       The kings that have revolted, and the soldier 2680
       That has this morning left thee, would have still
       Follow'd thy heels.

     * Antony. Who's gone this morning?

     * Soldier. Who!
       One ever near thee: call for Enobarbus, 2685
       He shall not hear thee; or from Caesar's camp
       Say 'I am none of thine.'

     * Antony. What say'st thou?

     * Soldier. Sir,
       He is with Caesar. 2690

     * Eros. Sir, his chests and treasure
       He has not with him.

     * Antony. Is he gone?

     * Soldier. Most certain.

     * Antony. Go, Eros, send his treasure after; do it; 2695
       Detain no jot, I charge thee: write to him—
       I will subscribe—gentle adieus and greetings;
       Say that I wish he never find more cause
       To change a master. O, my fortunes have
       Corrupted honest men! Dispatch.—Enobarbus! 2700

       Our will is Antony be took alive; 2705
       Make it so known.

     * Agrippa. Caesar, I shall.

   [Exit]
     * Octavius. The time of universal peace is near:
       Prove this a prosperous day, the three-nook'd world 2710
       Shall bear the olive freely.

   [Enter a Messenger]
     * Messenger. Antony
       Is come into the field.

     * Octavius. Go charge Agrippa 2715
       Plant those that have revolted in the van,
       That Antony may seem to spend his fury
       Upon himself.

   [Exeunt all but DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS]
     * Domitius Enobarus. Alexas did revolt; and went to Jewry on 2720
       Affairs of Antony; there did persuade
       Great Herod to incline himself to Caesar,
       And leave his master Antony: for this pains
       Caesar hath hang'd him. Canidius and the rest
       That fell away have entertainment, but 2725
       No honourable trust. I have done ill;
       Of which I do accuse myself so sorely,
       That I will joy no more.

   [Enter a Soldier of CAESAR's]
     * Soldier. Enobarbus, Antony 2730
       Hath after thee sent all thy treasure, with
       His bounty overplus: the messenger
       Came on my guard; and at thy tent is now
       Unloading of his mules.

     * Domitius Enobarus. I give it you. 2735

     * Soldier. Mock not, Enobarbus.
       I tell you true: best you safed the bringer
       Out of the host; I must attend mine office,
       Or would have done't myself. Your emperor
       Continues still a Jove. 2740

   [Exit]
     * Domitius Enobarus. I am alone the villain of the earth,
       And feel I am so most. O Antony,
       Thou mine of bounty, how wouldst thou have paid
       My better service, when my turpitude 2745
       Thou dost so crown with gold! This blows my heart:
       If swift thought break it not, a swifter mean
       Shall outstrike thought: but thought will do't, I feel.
       I fight against thee! No: I will go seek
       Some ditch wherein to die; the foul'st best fits 2750
       My latter part of life.

   [Exeunt]

   [Alarums. Enter MARK ANTONY and SCARUS wounded]
     * Scarus. O my brave emperor, this is fought indeed! 2760
       Had we done so at first, we had droven them home
       With clouts about their heads.

     * Antony. Thou bleed'st apace.

     * Scarus. I had a wound here that was like a T,
       But now 'tis made an H. 2765

     * Antony. They do retire.

     * Scarus. We'll beat 'em into bench-holes: I have yet
       Room for six scotches more.

   [Enter EROS]
     * Eros. They are beaten, sir, and our advantage serves 2770
       For a fair victory.

     * Scarus. Let us score their backs,
       And snatch 'em up, as we take hares, behind:
       'Tis sport to maul a runner.

     * Antony. I will reward thee 2775

       For thy good valour. Come thee on.

       And let the queen know of our gests. To-morrow,
       Before the sun shall see 's, we'll spill the blood
       That has to-day escaped. I thank you all; 2785
       For doughty-handed are you, and have fought
       Not as you served the cause, but as 't had been
       Each man's like mine; you have shown all Hectors.
       Enter the city, clip your wives, your friends,
       Tell them your feats; whilst they with joyful tears 2790
       Wash the congealment from your wounds, and kiss
       The honour'd gashes whole.
       [To SCARUS]
       Give me thy hand
       [Enter CLEOPATRA, attended] 2795
       To this great fairy I'll commend thy acts,
       Make her thanks bless thee.
       [To CLEOPATRA]
       O thou day o' the world,
       Chain mine arm'd neck; leap thou, attire and all, 2800
       Through proof of harness to my heart, and there
       Ride on the pants triumphing!

     * Cleopatra. Lord of lords!
       O infinite virtue, comest thou smiling from
       The world's great snare uncaught? 2805

     * Antony. My nightingale,
       We have beat them to their beds. What, girl!
       though grey
       Do something mingle with our younger brown, yet ha' we
       A brain that nourishes our nerves, and can 2810
       Get goal for goal of youth. Behold this man;
       Commend unto his lips thy favouring hand:
       Kiss it, my warrior: he hath fought to-day
       As if a god, in hate of mankind, had
       Destroy'd in such a shape. 2815

     * Cleopatra. I'll give thee, friend,
       An armour all of gold; it was a king's.

     * Antony. He has deserved it, were it carbuncled
       Like holy Phoebus' car. Give me thy hand:
       Through Alexandria make a jolly march; 2820
       Bear our hack'd targets like the men that owe them:
       Had our great palace the capacity
       To camp this host, we all would sup together,
       And drink carouses to the next day's fate,
       Which promises royal peril. Trumpeters, 2825
       With brazen din blast you the city's ear;
       Make mingle with rattling tabourines;
       That heaven and earth may strike their sounds together,
       Applauding our approach.

       Is shiny; and they say we shall embattle
       By the second hour i' the morn. 2835

     * Third Soldier. What man is this? 2840

     * Second Soldier. Stand close, and list him.

     * Domitius Enobarus. Be witness to me, O thou blessed moon,
       When men revolted shall upon record
       Bear hateful memory, poor Enobarbus did
       Before thy face repent! 2845

     * First Soldier. Enobarbus!

     * Third Soldier. Peace!
       Hark further.

     * Domitius Enobarus. O sovereign mistress of true melancholy,
       The poisonous damp of night disponge upon me, 2850
       That life, a very rebel to my will,
       May hang no longer on me: throw my heart
       Against the flint and hardness of my fault:
       Which, being dried with grief, will break to powder,
       And finish all foul thoughts. O Antony, 2855
       Nobler than my revolt is infamous,
       Forgive me in thine own particular;
       But let the world rank me in register
       A master-leaver and a fugitive:
       O Antony! O Antony! 2860

   [Dies]
     * Second Soldier. Let's speak To him.

     * First Soldier. Let's hear him, for the things he speaks
       May concern Caesar.

     * Third Soldier. Let's do so. But he sleeps. 2865

     * First Soldier. Swoons rather; for so bad a prayer as his
       Was never yet for sleep.

     * Second Soldier. Go we to him.

     * Third Soldier. Awake, sir, awake; speak to us.

     * Second Soldier. Hear you, sir? 2870

     * First Soldier. The hand of death hath raught him.
       [Drums afar off]
       Hark! the drums
       Demurely wake the sleepers. Let us bear him

       Like friends long lost. Triple-turn'd whore!
       'tis thou
       Hast sold me to this novice; and my heart
       Makes only wars on thee. Bid them all fly; 2920

       I have done all. Bid them all fly; begone.

       O sun, thy uprise shall I see no more:
       Fortune and Antony part here; even here 2925

       That spaniel'd me at heels, to whom I gave
       Their wishes, do discandy, melt their sweets
       On blossoming Caesar; and this pine is bark'd,
       That overtopp'd them all. Betray'd I am: 2930
       O this false soul of Egypt! this grave charm,—
       Whose eye beck'd forth my wars, and call'd them home;
       Whose bosom was my crownet, my chief end,—
       Like a right gipsy, hath, at fast and loose,
       Beguiled me to the very heart of loss. 2935
       What, Eros, Eros!
       [Enter CLEOPATRA]
       Ah, thou spell! Avaunt!

     * Cleopatra. Why is my lord enraged against his love?

     * Antony. Vanish, or I shall give thee thy deserving, 2940
       And blemish Caesar's triumph. Let him take thee,
       And hoist thee up to the shouting plebeians:
       Follow his chariot, like the greatest spot
       Of all thy sex; most monster-like, be shown
       For poor'st diminutives, for doits; and let 2945

       Might have prevented many. Eros, ho!
       The shirt of Nessus is upon me: teach me,
       Alcides, thou mine ancestor, thy rage:
       Let me lodge Lichas on the horns o' the moon; 2955
       And with those hands, that grasp'd the heaviest club,
       Subdue my worthiest self. The witch shall die:
       To the young Roman boy she hath sold me, and I fall
       Under this plot; she dies for't. Eros, ho!

       Mardian, go tell him I have slain myself; 2970
       Say, that the last I spoke was 'Antony,'
       And word it, prithee, piteously: hence, Mardian,
       And bring me how he takes my death.
       To the monument!

   [Exeunt]

   Act IV, Scene 14

   The same. Another room.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   [Enter MARK ANTONY and EROS]
     * Antony. Eros, thou yet behold'st me?

     * Eros. Ay, noble lord.

     * Antony. Sometimes we see a cloud that's dragonish;
       A vapour sometime like a bear or lion, 2980
       A tower'd citadel, a pendent rock,
       A forked mountain, or blue promontory
       With trees upon't, that nod unto the world,
       And mock our eyes with air: thou hast seen
       these signs; 2985
       They are black vesper's pageants.

     * Eros. Ay, my lord,

     * Antony. That which is now a horse, even with a thought
       The rack dislimns, and makes it indistinct,
       As water is in water. 2990

     * Eros. It does, my lord.

     * Antony. My good knave Eros, now thy captain is
       Even such a body: here I am Antony:
       Yet cannot hold this visible shape, my knave.
       I made these wars for Egypt: and the queen,— 2995
       Whose heart I thought I had, for she had mine;
       Which whilst it was mine had annex'd unto't
       A million more, now lost,—she, Eros, has
       Pack'd cards with Caesar, and false-play'd my glory
       Unto an enemy's triumph. 3000
       Nay, weep not, gentle Eros; there is left us
       Ourselves to end ourselves.
       [Enter MARDIAN]
       O! thy vile lady!
       She has robb'd me of my sword. 3005

     * Mardian. No, Antony;
       My mistress loved thee, and her fortunes mingled
       With thine entirely.

     * Antony. Hence, saucy eunuch; peace!
       She hath betray'd me and shall die the death. 3010

     * Mardian. Death of one person can be paid but once,
       And that she has discharged: what thou wouldst do
       Is done unto thy hand: the last she spake
       Was 'Antony! most noble Antony!'
       Then in the midst a tearing groan did break 3015
       The name of Antony; it was divided
       Between her heart and lips: she render'd life,
       Thy name so buried in her.

     * Antony. Dead, then?

     * Mardian. Dead. 3020

     * Antony. Unarm, Eros; the long day's task is done,
       And we must sleep.
       [To MARDIAN]
       That thou depart'st hence safe,
       Does pay thy labour richly; go. 3025
       [Exit MARDIAN]
       Off, pluck off:
       The seven-fold shield of Ajax cannot keep
       The battery from my heart. O, cleave, my sides!
       Heart, once be stronger than thy continent, 3030
       Crack thy frail case! Apace, Eros, apace.
       No more a soldier: bruised pieces, go;
       You have been nobly borne. From me awhile.
       [Exit EROS]
       I will o'ertake thee, Cleopatra, and 3035
       Weep for my pardon. So it must be, for now
       All length is torture: since the torch is out,
       Lie down, and stray no farther: now all labour
       Mars what it does; yea, very force entangles
       Itself with strength: seal then, and all is done. 3040
       Eros!—I come, my queen:—Eros!—Stay for me:
       Where souls do couch on flowers, we'll hand in hand,
       And with our sprightly port make the ghosts gaze:
       Dido and her AEneas shall want troops,
       And all the haunt be ours. Come, Eros, Eros! 3045

   [Re-enter EROS]
     * Eros. What would my lord?

     * Antony. Since Cleopatra died,
       I have lived in such dishonour, that the gods
       Detest my baseness. I, that with my sword 3050
       Quarter'd the world, and o'er green Neptune's back
       With ships made cities, condemn myself to lack
       The courage of a woman; less noble mind
       Than she which by her death our Caesar tells
       'I am conqueror of myself.' Thou art sworn, Eros, 3055
       That, when the exigent should come, which now
       Is come indeed, when I should see behind me
       The inevitable prosecution of
       Disgrace and horror, that, on my command,
       Thou then wouldst kill me: do't; the time is come: 3060
       Thou strikest not me, 'tis Caesar thou defeat'st.
       Put colour in thy cheek.

     * Eros. The gods withhold me!
       Shall I do that which all the Parthian darts,
       Though enemy, lost aim, and could not? 3065

     * Antony. Eros,
       Wouldst thou be window'd in great Rome and see
       Thy master thus with pleach'd arms, bending down
       His corrigible neck, his face subdued
       To penetrative shame, whilst the wheel'd seat 3070
       Of fortunate Caesar, drawn before him, branded
       His baseness that ensued?

     * Eros. I would not see't.

     * Antony. Come, then; for with a wound I must be cured.
       Draw that thy honest sword, which thou hast worn 3075
       Most useful for thy country.

     * Eros. O, sir, pardon me!

     * Antony. When I did make thee free, sworest thou not then
       To do this when I bade thee? Do it at once;
       Or thy precedent services are all 3080
       But accidents unpurposed. Draw, and come.

     * Eros. Turn from me, then, that noble countenance,
       Wherein the worship of the whole world lies.

     * Antony. Lo thee!

   [Turning from him]
     * Eros. My sword is drawn.

     * Antony. Then let it do at once
       The thing why thou hast drawn it.

     * Eros. My dear master,
       My captain, and my emperor, let me say, 3090
       Before I strike this bloody stroke, farewell.

     * Antony. 'Tis said, man; and farewell.

     * Eros. Farewell, great chief. Shall I strike now?

     * Antony. Now, Eros.

     * Eros. Why, there then: thus I do escape the sorrow 3095
       Of Antony's death.

   [Kills himself]
     * Antony. Thrice-nobler than myself!
       Thou teachest me, O valiant Eros, what
       I should, and thou couldst not. My queen and Eros 3100
       Have by their brave instruction got upon me
       A nobleness in record: but I will be
       A bridegroom in my death, and run into't
       As to a lover's bed. Come, then; and, Eros,
       Thy master dies thy scholar: to do thus 3105
       [Falling on his sword]
       I learn'd of thee. How! not dead? not dead?
       The guard, ho! O, dispatch me!

   [Enter DERCETAS and Guard]
     * First Guard. What's the noise? 3110

     * Antony. I have done my work in, friends: O, make an end
       Of what I have begun.

     * Second Guard. The star is fall'n.

     * First Guard. And time is at his period.

     * All. Alas, and woe! 3115

     * Antony. Let him that loves me strike me dead.

     * First Guard. Not I.

     * Second Guard. Nor I.

     * Third Guard. Nor any one.

   [Exeunt Guard]
     * Dercetas. Thy death and fortunes bid thy followers fly.
       This sword but shown to Caesar, with this tidings,
       Shall enter me with him.

   [Enter DIOMEDES]
     * Diomedes. Where's Antony? 3125

     * Dercetas. There, Diomed there.

     * Diomedes. Lives he?
       Wilt thou not answer, man?

   [Exit DERCETAS]
     * Antony. Art thou there, Diomed? Draw thy sword, and give me 3130
       Sufficing strokes for death.

     * Diomedes. Most absolute lord,
       My mistress Cleopatra sent me to thee.

     * Antony. When did she send thee?

     * Diomedes. Now, my lord. 3135

     * Antony. Where is she?

     * Diomedes. Lock'd in her monument. She had a prophesying fear
       Of what hath come to pass: for when she saw—
       Which never shall be found—you did suspect
       She had disposed with Caesar, and that your rage 3140
       Would not be purged, she sent you word she was dead;
       But, fearing since how it might work, hath sent
       Me to proclaim the truth; and I am come,
       I dread, too late.

     * Antony. Too late, good Diomed: call my guard, I prithee. 3145

     * Diomedes. What, ho, the emperor's guard! The guard, what, ho!
       Come, your lord calls!

   [Enter four or five of the Guard of MARK ANTONY]
     * Antony. Bear me, good friends, where Cleopatra bides;
       'Tis the last service that I shall command you. 3150

     * First Guard. Woe, woe are we, sir, you may not live to wear
       All your true followers out.

     * All. Most heavy day!

     * Antony. Nay, good my fellows, do not please sharp fate
       To grace it with your sorrows: bid that welcome 3155
       Which comes to punish us, and we punish it
       Seeming to bear it lightly. Take me up:
       I have led you oft: carry me now, good friends,
       And have my thanks for all.

   [Exeunt, bearing MARK ANTONY]

   Act IV, Scene 15

   The same. A monument.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   [Enter CLEOPATRA and her maids aloft, with] [p]CHARMIAN and IRAS]
     * Cleopatra. O Charmian, I will never go from hence.

     * Charmian. Be comforted, dear madam.

     * Cleopatra. No, I will not: 3165
       All strange and terrible events are welcome,
       But comforts we despise; our size of sorrow,
       Proportion'd to our cause, must be as great
       As that which makes it.
       [Enter, below, DIOMEDES] 3170
       How now! is he dead?

     * Diomedes. His death's upon him, but not dead.
       Look out o' the other side your monument;
       His guard have brought him thither.

   [Enter, below, MARK ANTONY, borne by the Guard]
     * Cleopatra. O sun,
       Burn the great sphere thou movest in!
       darkling stand
       The varying shore o' the world. O Antony,
       Antony, Antony! Help, Charmian, help, Iras, help; 3180
       Help, friends below; let's draw him hither.

     * Antony. Peace!
       Not Caesar's valour hath o'erthrown Antony,
       But Antony's hath triumph'd on itself.

     * Cleopatra. So it should be, that none but Antony 3185
       Should conquer Antony; but woe 'tis so!

     * Antony. I am dying, Egypt, dying; only
       I here importune death awhile, until
       Of many thousand kisses the poor last
       I lay up thy lips. 3190

     * Cleopatra. I dare not, dear,—
       Dear my lord, pardon,—I dare not,
       Lest I be taken: not the imperious show
       Of the full-fortuned Caesar ever shall
       Be brooch'd with me; if knife, drugs, 3195
       serpents, have
       Edge, sting, or operation, I am safe:
       Your wife Octavia, with her modest eyes
       And still conclusion, shall acquire no honour
       Demuring upon me. But come, come, Antony,— 3200
       Help me, my women,—we must draw thee up:
       Assist, good friends.

     * Antony. O, quick, or I am gone.

     * Cleopatra. Here's sport indeed! How heavy weighs my lord!
       Our strength is all gone into heaviness, 3205
       That makes the weight: had I great Juno's power,
       The strong-wing'd Mercury should fetch thee up,
       And set thee by Jove's side. Yet come a little,—
       Wishes were ever fools,—O, come, come, come;
       [They heave MARK ANTONY aloft to CLEOPATRA] 3210
       And welcome, welcome! die where thou hast lived:
       Quicken with kissing: had my lips that power,
       Thus would I wear them out.

     * All. A heavy sight!

     * Antony. I am dying, Egypt, dying: 3215
       Give me some wine, and let me speak a little.

     * Cleopatra. No, let me speak; and let me rail so high,
       That the false housewife Fortune break her wheel,
       Provoked by my offence.

     * Antony. One word, sweet queen: 3220
       Of Caesar seek your honour, with your safety. O!

     * Cleopatra. They do not go together.

     * Antony. Gentle, hear me:
       None about Caesar trust but Proculeius.

     * Cleopatra. My resolution and my hands I'll trust; 3225
       None about Caesar.

     * Antony. The miserable change now at my end
       Lament nor sorrow at; but please your thoughts
       In feeding them with those my former fortunes
       Wherein I lived, the greatest prince o' the world, 3230
       The noblest; and do now not basely die,
       Not cowardly put off my helmet to
       My countryman,—a Roman by a Roman
       Valiantly vanquish'd. Now my spirit is going;
       I can no more. 3235

     * Cleopatra. Noblest of men, woo't die?
       Hast thou no care of me? shall I abide
       In this dull world, which in thy absence is
       No better than a sty? O, see, my women,
       [MARK ANTONY dies] 3240
       The crown o' the earth doth melt. My lord!
       O, wither'd is the garland of the war,
       The soldier's pole is fall'n: young boys and girls
       Are level now with men; the odds is gone,
       And there is nothing left remarkable 3245
       Beneath the visiting moon.

   [Faints]
     * Charmian. O, quietness, lady!

     * Iras. She is dead too, our sovereign.

     * Charmian. Lady! 3250

     * Iras. Madam!

     * Charmian. O madam, madam, madam!

     * Iras. Royal Egypt, Empress!

     * Charmian. Peace, peace, Iras!

     * Cleopatra. No more, but e'en a woman, and commanded 3255
       By such poor passion as the maid that milks
       And does the meanest chares. It were for me
       To throw my sceptre at the injurious gods;
       To tell them that this world did equal theirs
       Till they had stol'n our jewel. All's but naught; 3260
       Patience is scottish, and impatience does
       Become a dog that's mad: then is it sin
       To rush into the secret house of death,
       Ere death dare come to us? How do you, women?
       What, what! good cheer! Why, how now, Charmian! 3265
       My noble girls! Ah, women, women, look,
       Our lamp is spent, it's out! Good sirs, take heart:
       We'll bury him; and then, what's brave,
       what's noble,
       Let's do it after the high Roman fashion, 3270
       And make death proud to take us. Come, away:
       This case of that huge spirit now is cold:
       Ah, women, women! come; we have no friend
       But resolution, and the briefest end.

   [Exeunt; those above bearing off MARK ANTONY's body]

   Act V, Scene 1

   Alexandria. OCTAVIUS CAESAR’s camp.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   [Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR, AGRIPPA, DOLABELLA, MECAENAS,] [p]GALLUS,
   PROCULEIUS, and others, his council of war]
     * Octavius. Go to him, Dolabella, bid him yield;
       Being so frustrate, tell him he mocks
       The pauses that he makes. 3280

     * Dolabella. Caesar, I shall.

   [Exit]

   [Enter DERCETAS, with the sword of MARK ANTONY]
     * Octavius. Wherefore is that? and what art thou that darest
       Appear thus to us? 3285

     * Dercetas. I am call'd Dercetas;
       Mark Antony I served, who best was worthy
       Best to be served: whilst he stood up and spoke,
       He was my master; and I wore my life
       To spend upon his haters. If thou please 3290
       To take me to thee, as I was to him
       I'll be to Caesar; if thou pleasest not,
       I yield thee up my life.

     * Octavius. What is't thou say'st?

     * Dercetas. I say, O Caesar, Antony is dead. 3295

     * Octavius. The breaking of so great a thing should make
       A greater crack: the round world
       Should have shook lions into civil streets,
       And citizens to their dens: the death of Antony
       Is not a single doom; in the name lay 3300
       A moiety of the world.

     * Dercetas. He is dead, Caesar:
       Not by a public minister of justice,
       Nor by a hired knife; but that self hand,
       Which writ his honour in the acts it did, 3305
       Hath, with the courage which the heart did lend it,
       Splitted the heart. This is his sword;
       I robb'd his wound of it; behold it stain'd
       With his most noble blood.

     * Octavius. Look you sad, friends? 3310
       The gods rebuke me, but it is tidings
       To wash the eyes of kings.

     * Agrippa. And strange it is,
       That nature must compel us to lament
       Our most persisted deeds. 3315

     * Mecaenas. His taints and honours
       Waged equal with him.

     * Agrippa. A rarer spirit never
       Did steer humanity: but you, gods, will give us
       Some faults to make us men. Caesar is touch'd. 3320

     * Mecaenas. When such a spacious mirror's set before him,
       He needs must see himself.

     * Octavius. O Antony!
       I have follow'd thee to this; but we do lance
       Diseases in our bodies: I must perforce 3325
       Have shown to thee such a declining day,
       Or look on thine; we could not stall together
       In the whole world: but yet let me lament,
       With tears as sovereign as the blood of hearts,
       That thou, my brother, my competitor 3330
       In top of all design, my mate in empire,
       Friend and companion in the front of war,
       The arm of mine own body, and the heart
       Where mine his thoughts did kindle,—that our stars,
       Unreconciliable, should divide 3335
       Our equalness to this. Hear me, good friends—
       But I will tell you at some meeter season:
       [Enter an Egyptian]
       The business of this man looks out of him;
       We'll hear him what he says. Whence are you? 3340

     * Egyptian. A poor Egyptian yet. The queen my mistress,
       Confined in all she has, her monument,
       Of thy intents desires instruction,
       That she preparedly may frame herself
       To the way she's forced to. 3345

     * Octavius. Bid her have good heart:
       She soon shall know of us, by some of ours,
       How honourable and how kindly we
       Determine for her; for Caesar cannot live
       To be ungentle. 3350

     * Egyptian. So the gods preserve thee!

   [Exit]
     * Octavius. Come hither, Proculeius. Go and say,
       We purpose her no shame: give her what comforts
       The quality of her passion shall require, 3355
       Lest, in her greatness, by some mortal stroke
       She do defeat us; for her life in Rome
       Would be eternal in our triumph: go,
       And with your speediest bring us what she says,
       And how you find of her. 3360

     * Proculeius. Caesar, I shall.

   [Exit]
     * Octavius. Gallus, go you along.
       [Exit GALLUS]
       Where's Dolabella, 3365
       To second Proculeius?

     * All. Dolabella!

     * Octavius. Let him alone, for I remember now
       How he's employ'd: he shall in time be ready.
       Go with me to my tent; where you shall see 3370
       How hardly I was drawn into this war;
       How calm and gentle I proceeded still
       In all my writings: go with me, and see
       What I can show in this.

   [Exeunt]

   Act V, Scene 2

   Alexandria. A room in the monument.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   [Enter CLEOPATRA, CHARMIAN, and IRAS]
     * Cleopatra. My desolation does begin to make
       A better life. 'Tis paltry to be Caesar;
       Not being Fortune, he's but Fortune's knave,
       A minister of her will: and it is great 3380
       To do that thing that ends all other deeds;
       Which shackles accidents and bolts up change;
       Which sleeps, and never palates more the dug,
       The beggar's nurse and Caesar's.
       [Enter, to the gates of the monument, PROCULEIUS,] 3385
       GALLUS and Soldiers]

     * Proculeius. Caesar sends greeting to the Queen of Egypt;
       And bids thee study on what fair demands
       Thou mean'st to have him grant thee.

     * Cleopatra. What's thy name? 3390

     * Proculeius. My name is Proculeius.

     * Cleopatra. Antony
       Did tell me of you, bade me trust you; but
       I do not greatly care to be deceived,
       That have no use for trusting. If your master 3395
       Would have a queen his beggar, you must tell him,
       That majesty, to keep decorum, must
       No less beg than a kingdom: if he please
       To give me conquer'd Egypt for my son,
       He gives me so much of mine own, as I 3400
       Will kneel to him with thanks.

     * Proculeius. Be of good cheer;
       You're fall'n into a princely hand, fear nothing:
       Make your full reference freely to my lord,
       Who is so full of grace, that it flows over 3405
       On all that need: let me report to him
       Your sweet dependency; and you shall find
       A conqueror that will pray in aid for kindness,
       Where he for grace is kneel'd to.

     * Cleopatra. Pray you, tell him 3410
       I am his fortune's vassal, and I send him
       The greatness he has got. I hourly learn
       A doctrine of obedience; and would gladly
       Look him i' the face.

     * Proculeius. This I'll report, dear lady. 3415
       Have comfort, for I know your plight is pitied
       Of him that caused it.

     * Gallus. You see how easily she may be surprised:
       [Here PROCULEIUS and two of the Guard ascend the]
       monument by a ladder placed against a window, and, 3420
       having descended, come behind CLEOPATRA. Some of
       the Guard unbar and open the gates]
       [To PROCULEIUS and the Guard]
       Guard her till Caesar come.

   [Exit]
     * Iras. Royal queen!

     * Charmian. O Cleopatra! thou art taken, queen:

     * Cleopatra. Quick, quick, good hands.

   [Drawing a dagger]
     * Proculeius. Hold, worthy lady, hold: 3430
       [Seizes and disarms her]
       Do not yourself such wrong, who are in this
       Relieved, but not betray'd.

     * Cleopatra. What, of death too,
       That rids our dogs of languish? 3435

     * Proculeius. Cleopatra,
       Do not abuse my master's bounty by
       The undoing of yourself: let the world see
       His nobleness well acted, which your death
       Will never let come forth. 3440

     * Cleopatra. Where art thou, death?
       Come hither, come! come, come, and take a queen
       Worthy many babes and beggars!

     * Proculeius. O, temperance, lady!

     * Cleopatra. Sir, I will eat no meat, I'll not drink, sir; 3445
       If idle talk will once be necessary,
       I'll not sleep neither: this mortal house I'll ruin,
       Do Caesar what he can. Know, sir, that I
       Will not wait pinion'd at your master's court;
       Nor once be chastised with the sober eye 3450
       Of dull Octavia. Shall they hoist me up
       And show me to the shouting varletry
       Of censuring Rome? Rather a ditch in Egypt
       Be gentle grave unto me! rather on Nilus' mud
       Lay me stark naked, and let the water-flies 3455
       Blow me into abhorring! rather make
       My country's high pyramides my gibbet,
       And hang me up in chains!

     * Proculeius. You do extend
       These thoughts of horror further than you shall 3460
       Find cause in Caesar.

   [Enter DOLABELLA]
     * Dolabella. Proculeius,
       What thou hast done thy master Caesar knows,
       And he hath sent for thee: for the queen, 3465
       I'll take her to my guard.

     * Proculeius. So, Dolabella,
       It shall content me best: be gentle to her.
       [To CLEOPATRA]
       To Caesar I will speak what you shall please, 3470
       If you'll employ me to him.

     * Cleopatra. Say, I would die.

   [Exeunt PROCULEIUS and Soldiers]
     * Dolabella. Most noble empress, you have heard of me?

     * Cleopatra. I cannot tell. 3475

     * Dolabella. Assuredly you know me.

     * Cleopatra. No matter, sir, what I have heard or known.
       You laugh when boys or women tell their dreams;
       Is't not your trick?

     * Dolabella. I understand not, madam. 3480

     * Cleopatra. I dream'd there was an Emperor Antony:
       O, such another sleep, that I might see
       But such another man!

     * Dolabella. If it might please ye,—

     * Cleopatra. His face was as the heavens; and therein stuck 3485
       A sun and moon, which kept their course,
       and lighted
       The little O, the earth.

     * Dolabella. Most sovereign creature,—

     * Cleopatra. His legs bestrid the ocean: his rear'd arm 3490
       Crested the world: his voice was propertied
       As all the tuned spheres, and that to friends;
       But when he meant to quail and shake the orb,
       He was as rattling thunder. For his bounty,
       There was no winter in't; an autumn 'twas 3495
       That grew the more by reaping: his delights
       Were dolphin-like; they show'd his back above
       The element they lived in: in his livery
       Walk'd crowns and crownets; realms and islands were
       As plates dropp'd from his pocket. 3500

     * Dolabella. Cleopatra!

     * Cleopatra. Think you there was, or might be, such a man
       As this I dream'd of?

     * Dolabella. Gentle madam, no.

     * Cleopatra. You lie, up to the hearing of the gods. 3505
       But, if there be, or ever were, one such,
       It's past the size of dreaming: nature wants stuff
       To vie strange forms with fancy; yet, to imagine
       And Antony, were nature's piece 'gainst fancy,
       Condemning shadows quite. 3510

     * Dolabella. Hear me, good madam.
       Your loss is as yourself, great; and you bear it
       As answering to the weight: would I might never
       O'ertake pursued success, but I do feel,
       By the rebound of yours, a grief that smites 3515
       My very heart at root.

     * Cleopatra. I thank you, sir,
       Know you what Caesar means to do with me?

     * Dolabella. I am loath to tell you what I would you knew.

     * Cleopatra. Nay, pray you, sir,— 3520

     * Dolabella. Though he be honourable,—

     * Cleopatra. He'll lead me, then, in triumph?

     * Dolabella. Madam, he will; I know't.
       [Flourish, and shout within, 'Make way there:]
       Octavius Caesar!'] 3525
       [Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR, GALLUS, PROCULEIUS,]
       MECAENAS, SELEUCUS, and others of his Train]

     * Octavius. Which is the Queen of Egypt?

     * Dolabella. It is the emperor, madam.

   [CLEOPATRA kneels]
     * Octavius. Arise, you shall not kneel:
       I pray you, rise; rise, Egypt.

     * Cleopatra. Sir, the gods
       Will have it thus; my master and my lord
       I must obey. 3535

     * Octavius. Take to you no hard thoughts:
       The record of what injuries you did us,
       Though written in our flesh, we shall remember
       As things but done by chance.

     * Cleopatra. Sole sir o' the world, 3540
       I cannot project mine own cause so well
       To make it clear; but do confess I have
       Been laden with like frailties which before
       Have often shamed our sex.

     * Octavius. Cleopatra, know, 3545
       We will extenuate rather than enforce:
       If you apply yourself to our intents,
       Which towards you are most gentle, you shall find
       A benefit in this change; but if you seek
       To lay on me a cruelty, by taking 3550
       Antony's course, you shall bereave yourself
       Of my good purposes, and put your children
       To that destruction which I'll guard them from,
       If thereon you rely. I'll take my leave.

     * Cleopatra. And may, through all the world: 'tis yours; and we, 3555
       Your scutcheons and your signs of conquest, shall
       Hang in what place you please. Here, my good lord.

     * Octavius. You shall advise me in all for Cleopatra.

     * Cleopatra. This is the brief of money, plate, and jewels,
       I am possess'd of: 'tis exactly valued; 3560
       Not petty things admitted. Where's Seleucus?

     * Seleucus. Here, madam.

     * Cleopatra. This is my treasurer: let him speak, my lord,
       Upon his peril, that I have reserved
       To myself nothing. Speak the truth, Seleucus. 3565

     * Seleucus. Madam,
       I had rather seal my lips, than, to my peril,
       Speak that which is not.

     * Cleopatra. What have I kept back?

     * Seleucus. Enough to purchase what you have made known. 3570

     * Octavius. Nay, blush not, Cleopatra; I approve
       Your wisdom in the deed.

     * Cleopatra. See, Caesar! O, behold,
       How pomp is follow'd! mine will now be yours;
       And, should we shift estates, yours would be mine. 3575
       The ingratitude of this Seleucus does
       Even make me wild: O slave, of no more trust
       Than love that's hired! What, goest thou back? thou shalt
       Go back, I warrant thee; but I'll catch thine eyes,
       Though they had wings: slave, soulless villain, dog! 3580
       O rarely base!

     * Octavius. Good queen, let us entreat you.

     * Cleopatra. O Caesar, what a wounding shame is this,
       That thou, vouchsafing here to visit me,
       Doing the honour of thy lordliness 3585
       To one so meek, that mine own servant should
       Parcel the sum of my disgraces by
       Addition of his envy! Say, good Caesar,
       That I some lady trifles have reserved,
       Immoment toys, things of such dignity 3590
       As we greet modern friends withal; and say,
       Some nobler token I have kept apart
       For Livia and Octavia, to induce
       Their mediation; must I be unfolded
       With one that I have bred? The gods! it smites me 3595
       Beneath the fall I have.
       [To SELEUCUS]
       Prithee, go hence;
       Or I shall show the cinders of my spirits
       Through the ashes of my chance: wert thou a man, 3600
       Thou wouldst have mercy on me.

     * Octavius. Forbear, Seleucus.

   [Exit SELEUCUS]
     * Cleopatra. Be it known, that we, the greatest, are misthought
       For things that others do; and, when we fall, 3605
       We answer others' merits in our name,
       Are therefore to be pitied.

     * Octavius. Cleopatra,
       Not what you have reserved, nor what acknowledged,
       Put we i' the roll of conquest: still be't yours, 3610
       Bestow it at your pleasure; and believe,
       Caesar's no merchant, to make prize with you
       Of things that merchants sold. Therefore be cheer'd;
       Make not your thoughts your prisons: no, dear queen;
       For we intend so to dispose you as 3615
       Yourself shall give us counsel. Feed, and sleep:
       Our care and pity is so much upon you,
       That we remain your friend; and so, adieu.

     * Cleopatra. My master, and my lord!

     * Octavius. Not so. Adieu. 3620

   [Flourish. Exeunt OCTAVIUS CAESAR and his train]
     * Cleopatra. He words me, girls, he words me, that I should not
       Be noble to myself: but, hark thee, Charmian.

   [Whispers CHARMIAN]
     * Iras. Finish, good lady; the bright day is done, 3625
       And we are for the dark.

     * Cleopatra. Hie thee again:
       I have spoke already, and it is provided;
       Go put it to the haste.

     * Charmian. Madam, I will. 3630

   [Re-enter DOLABELLA]
     * Dolabella. Where is the queen?

     * Charmian. Behold, sir.

   [Exit]
     * Cleopatra. Dolabella! 3635

     * Dolabella. Madam, as thereto sworn by your command,
       Which my love makes religion to obey,
       I tell you this: Caesar through Syria
       Intends his journey; and within three days
       You with your children will he send before: 3640
       Make your best use of this: I have perform'd
       Your pleasure and my promise.

     * Cleopatra. Dolabella,
       I shall remain your debtor.

     * Dolabella. I your servant, 3645
       Adieu, good queen; I must attend on Caesar.

     * Cleopatra. Farewell, and thanks.
       [Exit DOLABELLA]
       Now, Iras, what think'st thou?
       Thou, an Egyptian puppet, shalt be shown 3650
       In Rome, as well as I. mechanic slaves
       With greasy aprons, rules, and hammers, shall
       Uplift us to the view; in their thick breaths,
       Rank of gross diet, shall be enclouded,
       And forced to drink their vapour. 3655

     * Iras. The gods forbid!

     * Cleopatra. Nay, 'tis most certain, Iras: saucy lictors
       Will catch at us, like strumpets; and scald rhymers
       Ballad us out o' tune: the quick comedians
       Extemporally will stage us, and present 3660
       Our Alexandrian revels; Antony
       Shall be brought drunken forth, and I shall see
       Some squeaking Cleopatra boy my greatness
       I' the posture of a whore.

     * Iras. O the good gods! 3665

     * Cleopatra. Nay, that's certain.

     * Iras. I'll never see 't; for, I am sure, my nails
       Are stronger than mine eyes.

     * Cleopatra. Why, that's the way
       To fool their preparation, and to conquer 3670
       Their most absurd intents.
       [Re-enter CHARMIAN]
       Now, Charmian!
       Show me, my women, like a queen: go fetch
       My best attires: I am again for Cydnus, 3675
       To meet Mark Antony: sirrah Iras, go.
       Now, noble Charmian, we'll dispatch indeed;
       And, when thou hast done this chare, I'll give thee leave
       To play till doomsday. Bring our crown and all.
       Wherefore's this noise? 3680

   [Exit IRAS. A noise within]

   [Enter a Guardsman]
     * Guard. Here is a rural fellow
       That will not be denied your highness presence:
       He brings you figs. 3685

     * Cleopatra. Let him come in.
       [Exit Guardsman]
       What poor an instrument
       May do a noble deed! he brings me liberty.
       My resolution's placed, and I have nothing 3690
       Of woman in me: now from head to foot
       I am marble-constant; now the fleeting moon
       No planet is of mine.

   [Re-enter Guardsman, with Clown bringing in a basket]
     * Guard. This is the man. 3695

     * Cleopatra. Avoid, and leave him.
       [Exit Guardsman]
       Hast thou the pretty worm of Nilus there,
       That kills and pains not?

     * Clown. Truly, I have him: but I would not be the party 3700
       that should desire you to touch him, for his biting
       is immortal; those that do die of it do seldom or
       never recover.

     * Cleopatra. Rememberest thou any that have died on't?

     * Clown. Very many, men and women too. I heard of one of 3705
       them no longer than yesterday: a very honest woman,
       but something given to lie; as a woman should not
       do, but in the way of honesty: how she died of the
       biting of it, what pain she felt: truly, she makes
       a very good report o' the worm; but he that will 3710
       believe all that they say, shall never be saved by
       half that they do: but this is most fallible, the
       worm's an odd worm.

     * Cleopatra. Get thee hence; farewell.

     * Clown. I wish you all joy of the worm. 3715

   [Setting down his basket]
     * Cleopatra. Farewell.

     * Clown. You must think this, look you, that the worm will
       do his kind.

     * Cleopatra. Ay, ay; farewell. 3720

     * Clown. Look you, the worm is not to be trusted but in the
       keeping of wise people; for, indeed, there is no
       goodness in worm.

     * Cleopatra. Take thou no care; it shall be heeded.

     * Clown. Very good. Give it nothing, I pray you, for it is 3725
       not worth the feeding.

     * Cleopatra. Will it eat me?

     * Clown. You must not think I am so simple but I know the
       devil himself will not eat a woman: I know that a
       woman is a dish for the gods, if the devil dress her 3730
       not. But, truly, these same whoreson devils do the
       gods great harm in their women; for in every ten
       that they make, the devils mar five.

     * Cleopatra. Well, get thee gone; farewell.

     * Clown. Yes, forsooth: I wish you joy o' the worm. 3735

   [Exit]

   [Re-enter IRAS with a robe, crown, &c]
     * Cleopatra. Give me my robe, put on my crown; I have
       Immortal longings in me: now no more
       The juice of Egypt's grape shall moist this lip: 3740
       Yare, yare, good Iras; quick. Methinks I hear
       Antony call; I see him rouse himself
       To praise my noble act; I hear him mock
       The luck of Caesar, which the gods give men
       To excuse their after wrath: husband, I come: 3745
       Now to that name my courage prove my title!
       I am fire and air; my other elements
       I give to baser life. So; have you done?
       Come then, and take the last warmth of my lips.
       Farewell, kind Charmian; Iras, long farewell. 3750
       [Kisses them. IRAS falls and dies]
       Have I the aspic in my lips? Dost fall?
       If thou and nature can so gently part,
       The stroke of death is as a lover's pinch,
       Which hurts, and is desired. Dost thou lie still? 3755
       If thus thou vanishest, thou tell'st the world
       It is not worth leave-taking.

     * Charmian. Dissolve, thick cloud, and rain; that I may say,
       The gods themselves do weep!

     * Cleopatra. This proves me base: 3760
       If she first meet the curled Antony,
       He'll make demand of her, and spend that kiss
       Which is my heaven to have. Come, thou
       mortal wretch,
       [To an asp, which she applies to her breast] 3765
       With thy sharp teeth this knot intrinsicate
       Of life at once untie: poor venomous fool
       Be angry, and dispatch. O, couldst thou speak,
       That I might hear thee call great Caesar ass
       Unpolicied! 3770

     * Charmian. O eastern star!

     * Cleopatra. Peace, peace!
       Dost thou not see my baby at my breast,
       That sucks the nurse asleep?

     * Charmian. O, break! O, break! 3775

     * Cleopatra. As sweet as balm, as soft as air, as gentle,—
       O Antony!—Nay, I will take thee too.
       [Applying another asp to her arm]
       What should I stay—

   [Dies]
     * Charmian. In this vile world? So, fare thee well.
       Now boast thee, death, in thy possession lies
       A lass unparallel'd. Downy windows, close;
       And golden Phoebus never be beheld
       Of eyes again so royal! Your crown's awry; 3785
       I'll mend it, and then play.

   [Enter the Guard, rushing in]
     * First Guard. Where is the queen?

     * Charmian. Speak softly, wake her not.

     * First Guard. Caesar hath sent— 3790

     * Charmian. Too slow a messenger.
       [Applies an asp]
       O, come apace, dispatch! I partly feel thee.

     * First Guard. Approach, ho! All's not well: Caesar's beguiled.

     * Second Guard. There's Dolabella sent from Caesar; call him. 3795

     * First Guard. What work is here! Charmian, is this well done?

     * Charmian. It is well done, and fitting for a princess
       Descended of so many royal kings.
       Ah, soldier!

   [Dies]

   [Re-enter DOLABELLA]
     * Dolabella. How goes it here?

     * Second Guard. All dead.

     * Dolabella. Caesar, thy thoughts
       Touch their effects in this: thyself art coming 3805
       To see perform'd the dreaded act which thou
       So sought'st to hinder.

   [Within 'A way there, a way for Caesar!']

   [Re-enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR and all his train marching]
     * Dolabella. O sir, you are too sure an augurer; 3810
       That you did fear is done.

     * Octavius. Bravest at the last,
       She levell'd at our purposes, and, being royal,
       Took her own way. The manner of their deaths?
       I do not see them bleed. 3815

     * Dolabella. Who was last with them?

     * First Guard. A simple countryman, that brought her figs:
       This was his basket.

     * Octavius. Poison'd, then.

     * First Guard. O Caesar, 3820
       This Charmian lived but now; she stood and spake:
       I found her trimming up the diadem
       On her dead mistress; tremblingly she stood
       And on the sudden dropp'd.

     * Octavius. O noble weakness! 3825
       If they had swallow'd poison, 'twould appear
       By external swelling: but she looks like sleep,
       As she would catch another Antony
       In her strong toil of grace.

     * Dolabella. Here, on her breast, 3830
       There is a vent of blood and something blown:
       The like is on her arm.

     * First Guard. This is an aspic's trail: and these fig-leaves
       Have slime upon them, such as the aspic leaves
       Upon the caves of Nile. 3835

     * Octavius. Most probable
       That so she died; for her physician tells me
       She hath pursued conclusions infinite
       Of easy ways to die. Take up her bed;
       And bear her women from the monument: 3840
       She shall be buried by her Antony:
       No grave upon the earth shall clip in it
       A pair so famous. High events as these
       Strike those that make them; and their story is
       No less in pity than his glory which 3845
       Brought them to be lamented. Our army shall
       In solemn show attend this funeral;
       And then to Rome. Come, Dolabella, see
       High order in this great solemnity.

   [Exeunt]
