                                 SONNET CXIX

                  What potions have I drunk of Siren tears,
                Distill'd from limbecks foul as hell within,
                 Applying fears to hopes and hopes to fears,
                   Still losing when I saw myself to win!
               What wretched errors hath my heart committed, 5
               Whilst it hath thought itself so blessed never!
             How have mine eyes out of their spheres been fitted
                  In the distraction of this madding fever!
                      O benefit of ill! now I find true
                That better is by evil still made better; 10
                   And ruin'd love, when it is built anew,
            Grows fairer than at first, more strong, far greater.
                        So I return rebuked to my content
                And gain by ill thrice more than I have spent. 14
