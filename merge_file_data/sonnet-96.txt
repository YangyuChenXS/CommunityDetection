                                 SONNET XCVI

                Some say thy fault is youth, some wantonness;
                Some say thy grace is youth and gentle sport;
              Both grace and faults are loved of more and less;
               Thou makest faults graces that to thee resort.
                    As on the finger of a throned queen 5
                   The basest jewel will be well esteem'd,
                  So are those errors that in thee are seen
              To truths translated and for true things deem'd.
                 How many lambs might the stem wolf betray,
               If like a lamb he could his looks translate! 10
                   How many gazers mightst thou lead away,
             If thou wouldst use the strength of all thy state!
                     But do not so; I love thee in such sort
                As, thou being mine, mine is thy good report. 14
