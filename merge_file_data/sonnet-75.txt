                                 SONNET LXXV

                 So are you to my thoughts as food to life,
               Or as sweet-season'd showers are to the ground;
                 And for the peace of you I hold such strife
                 As 'twixt a miser and his wealth is found;
                     Now proud as an enjoyer and anon 5
             Doubting the filching age will steal his treasure,
                   Now counting best to be with you alone,
              Then better'd that the world may see my pleasure;
                Sometime all full with feasting on your sight
                 And by and by clean starved for a look; 10
                     Possessing or pursuing no delight,
                 Save what is had or must from you be took.
                     Thus do I pine and surfeit day by day,
                      Or gluttoning on all, or all away. 14
