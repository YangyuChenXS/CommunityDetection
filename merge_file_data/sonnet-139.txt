                     O, call not me to justify the wrong
                   That thy unkindness lays upon my heart;
              Wound me not with thine eye but with thy tongue;
                Use power with power and slay me not by art.
              Tell me thou lovest elsewhere, but in my sight, 5
               Dear heart, forbear to glance thine eye aside:
             What need'st thou wound with cunning when thy might
               Is more than my o'er-press'd defense can bide?
                 Let me excuse thee: ah! my love well knows
                 Her pretty looks have been mine enemies, 10
                And therefore from my face she turns my foes,
               That they elsewhere might dart their injuries:
                    Yet do not so; but since I am near slain,
                 Kill me outright with looks and rid my pain. 14

                                      O
