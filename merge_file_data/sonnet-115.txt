                 Those lines that I before have writ do lie,
              Even those that said I could not love you dearer:
                   Yet then my judgment knew no reason why
             My most full flame should afterwards burn clearer.
               But reckoning time, whose million'd accidents 5
              Creep in 'twixt vows and change decrees of kings,
               Tan sacred beauty, blunt the sharp'st intents,
            Divert strong minds to the course of altering things;
                    Alas, why, fearing of time's tyranny,
               Might I not then say 'Now I love you best,' 10
                    When I was certain o'er incertainty,
                 Crowning the present, doubting of the rest?
                    Love is a babe; then might I not say so,
              To give full growth to that which still doth grow? 14
