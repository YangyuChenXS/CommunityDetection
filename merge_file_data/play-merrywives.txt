   Act I, Scene 1

   Windsor. Before PAGE’s house.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   [Enter SHALLOW, SLENDER, and SIR HUGH EVANS]
     * Robert Shallow. Sir Hugh, persuade me not; I will make a Star-
       chamber matter of it: if he were twenty Sir John
       Falstaffs, he shall not abuse Robert Shallow, esquire.

     * Slender. In the county of Gloucester, justice of peace and 5
       'Coram.'

     * Robert Shallow. Ay, cousin Slender, and 'Custalourum.

     * Slender. Ay, and 'Rato-lorum' too; and a gentleman born,
       master parson; who writes himself 'Armigero,' in any
       bill, warrant, quittance, or obligation, 'Armigero.' 10

     * Robert Shallow. Ay, that I do; and have done any time these three
       hundred years.

     * Slender. All his successors gone before him hath done't; and
       all his ancestors that come after him may: they may
       give the dozen white luces in their coat. 15

     * Robert Shallow. It is an old coat.

     * Sir Hugh Evans. The dozen white louses do become an old coat well;
       it agrees well, passant; it is a familiar beast to
       man, and signifies love.

     * Robert Shallow. The luce is the fresh fish; the salt fish is an old
       coat. 20

     * Slender. I may quarter, coz.

     * Robert Shallow. You may, by marrying.

     * Sir Hugh Evans. It is marring indeed, if he quarter it.

     * Robert Shallow. Not a whit.

     * Sir Hugh Evans. Yes, py'r lady; if he has a quarter of your coat,
       25
       there is but three skirts for yourself, in my
       simple conjectures: but that is all one. If Sir
       John Falstaff have committed disparagements unto
       you, I am of the church, and will be glad to do my
       benevolence to make atonements and compremises 30
       between you.

     * Robert Shallow. The council shall bear it; it is a riot.

     * Sir Hugh Evans. It is not meet the council hear a riot; there is no
       fear of Got in a riot: the council, look you, shall
       desire to hear the fear of Got, and not to hear a 35
       riot; take your vizaments in that.

     * Robert Shallow. Ha! o' my life, if I were young again, the sword
       should end it.

     * Sir Hugh Evans. It is petter that friends is the sword, and end it:
       and there is also another device in my prain, which 40
       peradventure prings goot discretions with it: there
       is Anne Page, which is daughter to Master Thomas
       Page, which is pretty virginity.

     * Slender. Mistress Anne Page? She has brown hair, and speaks
       small like a woman. 45

     * Sir Hugh Evans. It is that fery person for all the orld, as just as
       you will desire; and seven hundred pounds of moneys,
       and gold and silver, is her grandsire upon his
       death's-bed—Got deliver to a joyful resurrections!
       —give, when she is able to overtake seventeen years 50
       old: it were a goot motion if we leave our pribbles
       and prabbles, and desire a marriage between Master
       Abraham and Mistress Anne Page.

     * Slender. Did her grandsire leave her seven hundred pound?

     * Sir Hugh Evans. Ay, and her father is make her a petter penny. 55

     * Slender. I know the young gentlewoman; she has good gifts.

     * Sir Hugh Evans. Seven hundred pounds and possibilities is goot
       gifts.

     * Robert Shallow. Well, let us see honest Master Page. Is Falstaff
       there?

     * Sir Hugh Evans. Shall I tell you a lie? I do despise a liar as I do
       despise one that is false, or as I despise one that 60
       is not true. The knight, Sir John, is there; and, I
       beseech you, be ruled by your well-willers. I will
       peat the door for Master Page.
       [Knocks]
       What, hoa! Got pless your house here! 65

     * Page. [Within] Who's there?

   [Enter PAGE]
     * Sir Hugh Evans. Here is Got's plessing, and your friend, and
       Justice
       Shallow; and here young Master Slender, that
       peradventures shall tell you another tale, if 70
       matters grow to your likings.

     * Page. I am glad to see your worships well.
       I thank you for my venison, Master Shallow.

     * Robert Shallow. Master Page, I am glad to see you: much good do it
       your good heart! I wished your venison better; it 75
       was ill killed. How doth good Mistress Page?—and I
       thank you always with my heart, la! with my heart.

     * Page. Sir, I thank you.

     * Robert Shallow. Sir, I thank you; by yea and no, I do.

     * Page. I am glad to see you, good Master Slender. 80

     * Slender. How does your fallow greyhound, sir? I heard say he
       was outrun on Cotsall.

     * Page. It could not be judged, sir.

     * Slender. You'll not confess, you'll not confess.

     * Robert Shallow. That he will not. 'Tis your fault, 'tis your fault;
       85
       'tis a good dog.

     * Page. A cur, sir.

     * Robert Shallow. Sir, he's a good dog, and a fair dog: can there be
       more said? he is good and fair. Is Sir John
       Falstaff here? 90

     * Page. Sir, he is within; and I would I could do a good
       office between you.

     * Sir Hugh Evans. It is spoke as a Christians ought to speak.

     * Robert Shallow. He hath wronged me, Master Page.

     * Page. Sir, he doth in some sort confess it. 95

     * Robert Shallow. If it be confessed, it is not redress'd: is not
       that
       so, Master Page? He hath wronged me; indeed he
       hath, at a word, he hath, believe me: Robert
       Shallow, esquire, saith, he is wronged.

     * Page. Here comes Sir John. 100

   [Enter FALSTAFF, BARDOLPH, NYM, and PISTOL]
     * Falstaff. Now, Master Shallow, you'll complain of me to the king?

     * Robert Shallow. Knight, you have beaten my men, killed my deer, and
       broke open my lodge.

     * Falstaff. But not kissed your keeper's daughter? 105

     * Robert Shallow. Tut, a pin! this shall be answered.

     * Falstaff. I will answer it straight; I have done all this.
       That is now answered.

     * Robert Shallow. The council shall know this.

     * Falstaff. 'Twere better for you if it were known in counsel: 110
       you'll be laughed at.

     * Sir Hugh Evans. Pauca verba, Sir John; goot worts.

     * Falstaff. Good worts! good cabbage. Slender, I broke your
       head: what matter have you against me?

     * Slender. Marry, sir, I have matter in my head against you; 115
       and against your cony-catching rascals, Bardolph,
       Nym, and Pistol.

     * Bardolph. You Banbury cheese!

     * Slender. Ay, it is no matter.

     * Pistol. How now, Mephostophilus! 120

     * Slender. Ay, it is no matter.

     * Nym. Slice, I say! pauca, pauca: slice! that's my humour.

     * Slender. Where's Simple, my man? Can you tell, cousin?

     * Sir Hugh Evans. Peace, I pray you. Now let us understand. There is
       three umpires in this matter, as I understand; that 125
       is, Master Page, fidelicet Master Page; and there is
       myself, fidelicet myself; and the three party is,
       lastly and finally, mine host of the Garter.

     * Page. We three, to hear it and end it between them.

     * Sir Hugh Evans. Fery goot: I will make a prief of it in my note-
       130
       book; and we will afterwards ork upon the cause with
       as great discreetly as we can.

     * Falstaff. Pistol!

     * Pistol. He hears with ears.

     * Sir Hugh Evans. The tevil and his tam! what phrase is this, 'He 135
       hears with ear'? why, it is affectations.

     * Falstaff. Pistol, did you pick Master Slender's purse?

     * Slender. Ay, by these gloves, did he, or I would I might
       never come in mine own great chamber again else, of
       seven groats in mill-sixpences, and two Edward 140
       shovel-boards, that cost me two shilling and two
       pence apiece of Yead Miller, by these gloves.

     * Falstaff. Is this true, Pistol?

     * Sir Hugh Evans. No; it is false, if it is a pick-purse.

     * Pistol. Ha, thou mountain-foreigner! Sir John and Master mine, 145
       I combat challenge of this latten bilbo.
       Word of denial in thy labras here!
       Word of denial: froth and scum, thou liest!

     * Slender. By these gloves, then, 'twas he.

     * Nym. Be avised, sir, and pass good humours: I will say 150
       'marry trap' with you, if you run the nuthook's
       humour on me; that is the very note of it.

     * Slender. By this hat, then, he in the red face had it; for
       though I cannot remember what I did when you made me
       drunk, yet I am not altogether an ass. 155

     * Falstaff. What say you, Scarlet and John?

     * Bardolph. Why, sir, for my part I say the gentleman had drunk
       himself out of his five sentences.

     * Sir Hugh Evans. It is his five senses: fie, what the ignorance is!

     * Bardolph. And being fap, sir, was, as they say, cashiered; and 160
       so conclusions passed the careires.

     * Slender. Ay, you spake in Latin then too; but 'tis no
       matter: I'll ne'er be drunk whilst I live again,
       but in honest, civil, godly company, for this trick:
       if I be drunk, I'll be drunk with those that have 165
       the fear of God, and not with drunken knaves.

     * Sir Hugh Evans. So Got udge me, that is a virtuous mind.

     * Falstaff. You hear all these matters denied, gentlemen; you hear
       it.
       [Enter ANNE PAGE, with wine; MISTRESS FORD]
       and MISTRESS PAGE, following] 170

     * Page. Nay, daughter, carry the wine in; we'll drink within.

   [Exit ANNE PAGE]
     * Slender. O heaven! this is Mistress Anne Page.

     * Page. How now, Mistress Ford!

     * Falstaff. Mistress Ford, by my troth, you are very well met: 175
       by your leave, good mistress.

   [Kisses her]
     * Page. Wife, bid these gentlemen welcome. Come, we have a
       hot venison pasty to dinner: come, gentlemen, I hope
       we shall drink down all unkindness. 180

   [Exeunt all except SHALLOW, SLENDER, and SIR HUGH EVANS]
     * Slender. I had rather than forty shillings I had my Book of
       Songs and Sonnets here.
       [Enter SIMPLE]
       How now, Simple! where have you been? I must wait 185
       on myself, must I? You have not the Book of Riddles
       about you, have you?

     * Simple. Book of Riddles! why, did you not lend it to Alice
       Shortcake upon All-hallowmas last, a fortnight
       afore Michaelmas? 190

     * Robert Shallow. Come, coz; come, coz; we stay for you. A word with
       you, coz; marry, this, coz: there is, as 'twere, a
       tender, a kind of tender, made afar off by Sir Hugh
       here. Do you understand me?

     * Slender. Ay, sir, you shall find me reasonable; if it be so, 195
       I shall do that that is reason.

     * Robert Shallow. Nay, but understand me.

     * Slender. So I do, sir.

     * Sir Hugh Evans. Give ear to his motions, Master Slender: I will
       description the matter to you, if you be capacity of it. 200

     * Slender. Nay, I will do as my cousin Shallow says: I pray
       you, pardon me; he's a justice of peace in his
       country, simple though I stand here.

     * Sir Hugh Evans. But that is not the question: the question is
       concerning your marriage. 205

     * Robert Shallow. Ay, there's the point, sir.

     * Sir Hugh Evans. Marry, is it; the very point of it; to Mistress
       Anne Page.

     * Slender. Why, if it be so, I will marry her upon any
       reasonable demands.

     * Sir Hugh Evans. But can you affection the 'oman? Let us command to
       210
       know that of your mouth or of your lips; for divers
       philosophers hold that the lips is parcel of the
       mouth. Therefore, precisely, can you carry your
       good will to the maid?

     * Robert Shallow. Cousin Abraham Slender, can you love her? 215

     * Slender. I hope, sir, I will do as it shall become one that
       would do reason.

     * Sir Hugh Evans. Nay, Got's lords and his ladies! you must speak
       possitable, if you can carry her your desires
       towards her. 220

     * Robert Shallow. That you must. Will you, upon good dowry, marry
       her?

     * Slender. I will do a greater thing than that, upon your
       request, cousin, in any reason.

     * Robert Shallow. Nay, conceive me, conceive me, sweet coz: what I do
       is to pleasure you, coz. Can you love the maid? 225

     * Slender. I will marry her, sir, at your request: but if there
       be no great love in the beginning, yet heaven may
       decrease it upon better acquaintance, when we are
       married and have more occasion to know one another;
       I hope, upon familiarity will grow more contempt: 230
       but if you say, 'Marry her,' I will marry her; that
       I am freely dissolved, and dissolutely.

     * Sir Hugh Evans. It is a fery discretion answer; save the fall is in
       the ort 'dissolutely:' the ort is, according to our
       meaning, 'resolutely:' his meaning is good. 235

     * Robert Shallow. Ay, I think my cousin meant well.

     * Slender. Ay, or else I would I might be hanged, la!

     * Robert Shallow. Here comes fair Mistress Anne.
       [Re-enter ANNE PAGE]
       Would I were young for your sake, Mistress Anne! 240

     * Anne Page. The dinner is on the table; my father desires your
       worships' company.

     * Robert Shallow. I will wait on him, fair Mistress Anne.

     * Sir Hugh Evans. Od's plessed will! I will not be absence at the
       grace.

   [Exeunt SHALLOW and SIR HUGH EVANS]
     * Anne Page. Will't please your worship to come in, sir?

     * Slender. No, I thank you, forsooth, heartily; I am very well.

     * Anne Page. The dinner attends you, sir.

     * Slender. I am not a-hungry, I thank you, forsooth. Go,
       sirrah, for all you are my man, go wait upon my 250
       cousin Shallow.
       [Exit SIMPLE]
       A justice of peace sometimes may be beholding to his
       friend for a man. I keep but three men and a boy
       yet, till my mother be dead: but what though? Yet I 255
       live like a poor gentleman born.

     * Anne Page. I may not go in without your worship: they will not
       sit till you come.

     * Slender. I' faith, I'll eat nothing; I thank you as much as
       though I did. 260

     * Anne Page. I pray you, sir, walk in.

     * Slender. I had rather walk here, I thank you. I bruised
       my shin th' other day with playing at sword and
       dagger with a master of fence; three veneys for a
       dish of stewed prunes; and, by my troth, I cannot 265
       abide the smell of hot meat since. Why do your
       dogs bark so? be there bears i' the town?

     * Anne Page. I think there are, sir; I heard them talked of.

     * Slender. I love the sport well but I shall as soon quarrel at
       it as any man in England. You are afraid, if you see 270
       the bear loose, are you not?

     * Anne Page. Ay, indeed, sir.

     * Slender. That's meat and drink to me, now. I have seen
       Sackerson loose twenty times, and have taken him by
       the chain; but, I warrant you, the women have so 275
       cried and shrieked at it, that it passed: but women,
       indeed, cannot abide 'em; they are very ill-favored
       rough things.

   [Re-enter PAGE]
     * Page. Come, gentle Master Slender, come; we stay for you. 280

     * Slender. I'll eat nothing, I thank you, sir.

     * Page. By cock and pie, you shall not choose, sir! come, come.

     * Slender. Nay, pray you, lead the way.

     * Page. Come on, sir.

     * Slender. Mistress Anne, yourself shall go first. 285

     * Anne Page. Not I, sir; pray you, keep on.

     * Slender. I'll rather be unmannerly than troublesome.
       You do yourself wrong, indeed, la!

   [Exeunt]
   _______________________________________________________________________



   Act I, Scene 2

   The same.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   [Enter SIR HUGH EVANS and SIMPLE]
     * Sir Hugh Evans. Go your ways, and ask of Doctor Caius' house which
       is the way: and there dwells one Mistress Quickly,
       which is in the manner of his nurse, or his dry
       nurse, or his cook, or his laundry, his washer, and
       his wringer. 295

     * Simple. Well, sir.

     * Sir Hugh Evans. Nay, it is petter yet. Give her this letter; for it
       is a 'oman that altogether's acquaintance with
       Mistress Anne Page: and the letter is, to desire
       and require her to solicit your master's desires to 300
       Mistress Anne Page. I pray you, be gone: I will
       make an end of my dinner; there's pippins and cheese to come.

   [Exeunt]

   Act I, Scene 3

   A room in the Garter Inn.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   [Enter FALSTAFF, Host, BARDOLPH, NYM, PISTOL,] [p]and ROBIN]
     * Falstaff. Mine host of the Garter!

     * Host. What says my bully-rook? speak scholarly and wisely.

     * Falstaff. Truly, mine host, I must turn away some of my
       followers.

     * Host. Discard, bully Hercules; cashier: let them wag; trot, trot.
       310

     * Falstaff. I sit at ten pounds a week.

     * Host. Thou'rt an emperor, Caesar, Keisar, and Pheezar. I
       will entertain Bardolph; he shall draw, he shall
       tap: said I well, bully Hector?

     * Falstaff. Do so, good mine host. 315

     * Host. I have spoke; let him follow.
       [To BARDOLPH]
       Let me see thee froth and lime: I am at a word; follow.

   [Exit]
     * Falstaff. Bardolph, follow him. A tapster is a good trade: 320
       an old cloak makes a new jerkin; a withered
       serving-man a fresh tapster. Go; adieu.

     * Bardolph. It is a life that I have desired: I will thrive.

     * Pistol. O base Hungarian wight! wilt thou the spigot wield?

   [Exit BARDOLPH]
     * Nym. He was gotten in drink: is not the humour conceited?

     * Falstaff. I am glad I am so acquit of this tinderbox: his
       thefts were too open; his filching was like an
       unskilful singer; he kept not time.

     * Nym. The good humour is to steal at a minute's rest. 330

     * Pistol. 'Convey,' the wise it call. 'Steal!' foh! a fico
       for the phrase!

     * Falstaff. Well, sirs, I am almost out at heels.

     * Pistol. Why, then, let kibes ensue.

     * Falstaff. There is no remedy; I must cony-catch; I must shift. 335

     * Pistol. Young ravens must have food.

     * Falstaff. Which of you know Ford of this town?

     * Pistol. I ken the wight: he is of substance good.

     * Falstaff. My honest lads, I will tell you what I am about.

     * Pistol. Two yards, and more. 340

     * Falstaff. No quips now, Pistol! Indeed, I am in the waist two
       yards about; but I am now about no waste; I am about
       thrift. Briefly, I do mean to make love to Ford's
       wife: I spy entertainment in her; she discourses,
       she carves, she gives the leer of invitation: I 345
       can construe the action of her familiar style; and
       the hardest voice of her behavior, to be Englished
       rightly, is, 'I am Sir John Falstaff's.'

     * Pistol. He hath studied her will, and translated her will,
       out of honesty into English. 350

     * Nym. The anchor is deep: will that humour pass?

     * Falstaff. Now, the report goes she has all the rule of her
       husband's purse: he hath a legion of angels.

     * Pistol. As many devils entertain; and 'To her, boy,' say I.

     * Nym. The humour rises; it is good: humour me the angels. 355

     * Falstaff. I have writ me here a letter to her: and here
       another to Page's wife, who even now gave me good
       eyes too, examined my parts with most judicious
       oeillades; sometimes the beam of her view gilded my
       foot, sometimes my portly belly. 360

     * Pistol. Then did the sun on dunghill shine.

     * Nym. I thank thee for that humour.

     * Falstaff. O, she did so course o'er my exteriors with such a
       greedy intention, that the appetite of her eye did
       seem to scorch me up like a burning-glass! Here's 365
       another letter to her: she bears the purse too; she
       is a region in Guiana, all gold and bounty. I will
       be cheater to them both, and they shall be
       exchequers to me; they shall be my East and West
       Indies, and I will trade to them both. Go bear thou 370
       this letter to Mistress Page; and thou this to
       Mistress Ford: we will thrive, lads, we will thrive.

     * Pistol. Shall I Sir Pandarus of Troy become,
       And by my side wear steel? then, Lucifer take all!

     * Nym. I will run no base humour: here, take the 375
       humour-letter: I will keep the havior of reputation.

     * Falstaff. [To ROBIN] Hold, sirrah, bear you these letters tightly;
       Sail like my pinnace to these golden shores.
       Rogues, hence, avaunt! vanish like hailstones, go;
       Trudge, plod away o' the hoof; seek shelter, pack! 380
       Falstaff will learn the humour of the age,
       French thrift, you rogues; myself and skirted page.

   [Exeunt FALSTAFF and ROBIN]
     * Pistol. Let vultures gripe thy guts! for gourd and fullam holds,
       And high and low beguiles the rich and poor: 385
       Tester I'll have in pouch when thou shalt lack,
       Base Phrygian Turk!

     * Nym. I have operations which be humours of revenge.

     * Pistol. Wilt thou revenge?

     * Nym. By welkin and her star! 390

     * Pistol. With wit or steel?

     * Nym. With both the humours, I:
       I will discuss the humour of this love to Page.

     * Pistol. And I to Ford shall eke unfold
       How Falstaff, varlet vile, 395
       His dove will prove, his gold will hold,
       And his soft couch defile.

     * Nym. My humour shall not cool: I will incense Page to
       deal with poison; I will possess him with
       yellowness, for the revolt of mine is dangerous: 400
       that is my true humour.

     * Pistol. Thou art the Mars of malecontents: I second thee; troop on.

   Act I, Scene 4

   A room in DOCTOR CAIUS’ house.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   [Enter MISTRESS QUICKLY, SIMPLE, and RUGBY]
     * Hostess Quickly. What, John Rugby! I pray thee, go to the casement,
       405
       and see if you can see my master, Master Doctor
       Caius, coming. If he do, i' faith, and find any
       body in the house, here will be an old abusing of
       God's patience and the king's English.

     * Rugby. I'll go watch. 410

     * Hostess Quickly. Go; and we'll have a posset for't soon at night,
       in
       faith, at the latter end of a sea-coal fire.
       [Exit RUGBY]
       An honest, willing, kind fellow, as ever servant
       shall come in house withal, and, I warrant you, no 415
       tell-tale nor no breed-bate: his worst fault is,
       that he is given to prayer; he is something peevish
       that way: but nobody but has his fault; but let
       that pass. Peter Simple, you say your name is?

     * Simple. Ay, for fault of a better. 420

     * Hostess Quickly. And Master Slender's your master?

     * Simple. Ay, forsooth.

     * Hostess Quickly. Does he not wear a great round beard, like a
       glover's paring-knife?

     * Simple. No, forsooth: he hath but a little wee face, with a 425
       little yellow beard, a Cain-coloured beard.

     * Hostess Quickly. A softly-sprighted man, is he not?

     * Simple. Ay, forsooth: but he is as tall a man of his hands
       as any is between this and his head; he hath fought
       with a warrener. 430

     * Hostess Quickly. How say you? O, I should remember him: does he not
       hold up his head, as it were, and strut in his gait?

     * Simple. Yes, indeed, does he.

     * Hostess Quickly. Well, heaven send Anne Page no worse fortune! Tell
       Master Parson Evans I will do what I can for your 435
       master: Anne is a good girl, and I wish—

   [Re-enter RUGBY]
     * Rugby. Out, alas! here comes my master.

     * Hostess Quickly. We shall all be shent. Run in here, good young
       man;
       go into this closet: he will not stay long. 440
       [Shuts SIMPLE in the closet]
       What, John Rugby! John! what, John, I say!
       Go, John, go inquire for my master; I doubt
       he be not well, that he comes not home.
       [Singing] 445
       And down, down, adown-a, &c.

   [Enter DOCTOR CAIUS]
     * Doctor Caius. Vat is you sing? I do not like des toys. Pray you,
       go and vetch me in my closet un boitier vert, a box,
       a green-a box: do intend vat I speak? a green-a box. 450

     * Hostess Quickly. Ay, forsooth; I'll fetch it you.
       [Aside]
       I am glad he went not in himself: if he had found
       the young man, he would have been horn-mad.

     * Doctor Caius. Fe, fe, fe, fe! ma foi, il fait fort chaud. Je 455
       m'en vais a la cour—la grande affaire.

     * Hostess Quickly. Is it this, sir?

     * Doctor Caius. Oui; mette le au mon pocket: depeche, quickly. Vere
       is dat knave Rugby?

     * Hostess Quickly. What, John Rugby! John! 460

     * Rugby. Here, sir!

     * Doctor Caius. You are John Rugby, and you are Jack Rugby. Come,
       take-a your rapier, and come after my heel to the court.

     * Rugby. 'Tis ready, sir, here in the porch.

     * Doctor Caius. By my trot, I tarry too long. Od's me! 465
       Qu'ai-j'oublie! dere is some simples in my closet,
       dat I vill not for the varld I shall leave behind.

     * Hostess Quickly. Ay me, he'll find the young man here, and be mad!

     * Doctor Caius. O diable, diable! vat is in my closet? Villain!
       larron!
       [Pulling SIMPLE out] 470
       Rugby, my rapier!

     * Hostess Quickly. Good master, be content.

     * Doctor Caius. Wherefore shall I be content-a?

     * Hostess Quickly. The young man is an honest man.

     * Doctor Caius. What shall de honest man do in my closet? dere is 475
       no honest man dat shall come in my closet.

     * Hostess Quickly. I beseech you, be not so phlegmatic. Hear the
       truth
       of it: he came of an errand to me from Parson Hugh.

     * Doctor Caius. Vell.

     * Simple. Ay, forsooth; to desire her to— 480

     * Hostess Quickly. Peace, I pray you.

     * Doctor Caius. Peace-a your tongue. Speak-a your tale.

     * Simple. To desire this honest gentlewoman, your maid, to
       speak a good word to Mistress Anne Page for my
       master in the way of marriage. 485

     * Hostess Quickly. This is all, indeed, la! but I'll ne'er put my
       finger in the fire, and need not.

     * Doctor Caius. Sir Hugh send-a you? Rugby, baille me some paper.
       Tarry you a little-a while.

   [Writes]
     * Hostess Quickly. [Aside to SIMPLE] I am glad he is so quiet: if he
       had been thoroughly moved, you should have heard him
       so loud and so melancholy. But notwithstanding,
       man, I'll do you your master what good I can: and
       the very yea and the no is, the French doctor, my 495
       master,—I may call him my master, look you, for I
       keep his house; and I wash, wring, brew, bake,
       scour, dress meat and drink, make the beds and do
       all myself,—

     * Simple. [Aside to MISTRESS QUICKLY] 'Tis a great charge to 500
       come under one body's hand.

     * Hostess Quickly. [Aside to SIMPLE] Are you avised o' that? you
       shall find it a great charge: and to be up early
       and down late; but notwithstanding,—to tell you in
       your ear; I would have no words of it,—my master 505
       himself is in love with Mistress Anne Page: but
       notwithstanding that, I know Anne's mind,—that's
       neither here nor there.

     * Doctor Caius. You jack'nape, give-a this letter to Sir Hugh; by
       gar, it is a shallenge: I will cut his troat in dee 510
       park; and I will teach a scurvy jack-a-nape priest
       to meddle or make. You may be gone; it is not good
       you tarry here. By gar, I will cut all his two
       stones; by gar, he shall not have a stone to throw
       at his dog: 515

   [Exit SIMPLE]
     * Hostess Quickly. Alas, he speaks but for his friend.

     * Doctor Caius. It is no matter-a ver dat: do not you tell-a me
       dat I shall have Anne Page for myself? By gar, I
       vill kill de Jack priest; and I have appointed mine 520
       host of de Jarteer to measure our weapon. By gar, I
       will myself have Anne Page.

     * Hostess Quickly. Sir, the maid loves you, and all shall be well. We
       must give folks leave to prate: what, the good-jer!

     * Doctor Caius. Rugby, come to the court with me. By gar, if I have
       525
       not Anne Page, I shall turn your head out of my
       door. Follow my heels, Rugby.

   [Exeunt DOCTOR CAIUS and RUGBY]
     * Hostess Quickly. You shall have An fool's-head of your own. No, I
       know Anne's mind for that: never a woman in Windsor 530
       knows more of Anne's mind than I do; nor can do more
       than I do with her, I thank heaven.

     * Fenton. [Within] Who's within there? ho!

     * Hostess Quickly. Who's there, I trow! Come near the house, I pray
       you.

   [Enter FENTON]
     * Fenton. How now, good woman? how dost thou?

     * Hostess Quickly. The better that it pleases your good worship to
       ask.

     * Fenton. What news? how does pretty Mistress Anne?

     * Hostess Quickly. In truth, sir, and she is pretty, and honest, and
       gentle; and one that is your friend, I can tell you 540
       that by the way; I praise heaven for it.

     * Fenton. Shall I do any good, thinkest thou? shall I not lose my
       suit?

     * Hostess Quickly. Troth, sir, all is in his hands above: but
       notwithstanding, Master Fenton, I'll be sworn on a
       book, she loves you. Have not your worship a wart 545
       above your eye?

     * Fenton. Yes, marry, have I; what of that?

     * Hostess Quickly. Well, thereby hangs a tale: good faith, it is such
       another Nan; but, I detest, an honest maid as ever
       broke bread: we had an hour's talk of that wart. I 550
       shall never laugh but in that maid's company! But
       indeed she is given too much to allicholy and
       musing: but for you—well, go to.

     * Fenton. Well, I shall see her to-day. Hold, there's money
       for thee; let me have thy voice in my behalf: if 555
       thou seest her before me, commend me.

     * Hostess Quickly. Will I? i'faith, that we will; and I will tell
       your
       worship more of the wart the next time we have
       confidence; and of other wooers.

     * Fenton. Well, farewell; I am in great haste now. 560

     * Hostess Quickly. Farewell to your worship.
       [Exit FENTON]
       Truly, an honest gentleman: but Anne loves him not;
       for I know Anne's mind as well as another does. Out
       upon't! what have I forgot? 565

   [Exit]

   Act II, Scene 1

   Before PAGE’S house.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   [Enter MISTRESS PAGE, with a letter]
     * Mistress Page. What, have I scaped love-letters in the holiday-
       time of my beauty, and am I now a subject for them?
       Let me see. 570
       [Reads]
       'Ask me no reason why I love you; for though
       Love use Reason for his physician, he admits him
       not for his counsellor. You are not young, no more
       am I; go to then, there's sympathy: you are merry, 575
       so am I; ha, ha! then there's more sympathy: you
       love sack, and so do I; would you desire better
       sympathy? Let it suffice thee, Mistress Page,—at
       the least, if the love of soldier can suffice,—
       that I love thee. I will not say, pity me; 'tis 580
       not a soldier-like phrase: but I say, love me. By me,
       Thine own true knight,
       By day or night,
       Or any kind of light,
       With all his might 585
       For thee to fight, JOHN FALSTAFF'
       What a Herod of Jewry is this! O wicked
       world! One that is well-nigh worn to pieces with
       age to show himself a young gallant! What an
       unweighed behavior hath this Flemish drunkard 590
       picked—with the devil's name!—out of my
       conversation, that he dares in this manner assay me?
       Why, he hath not been thrice in my company! What
       should I say to him? I was then frugal of my
       mirth: Heaven forgive me! Why, I'll exhibit a bill 595
       in the parliament for the putting down of men. How
       shall I be revenged on him? for revenged I will be,
       as sure as his guts are made of puddings.

   [Enter MISTRESS FORD]
     * Mistress Ford. Mistress Page! trust me, I was going to your house.
       600

     * Mistress Page. And, trust me, I was coming to you. You look very
       ill.

     * Mistress Ford. Nay, I'll ne'er believe that; I have to show to the
       contrary.

     * Mistress Page. Faith, but you do, in my mind.

     * Mistress Ford. Well, I do then; yet I say I could show you to the
       605
       contrary. O Mistress Page, give me some counsel!

     * Mistress Page. What's the matter, woman?

     * Mistress Ford. O woman, if it were not for one trifling respect, I
       could come to such honour!

     * Mistress Page. Hang the trifle, woman! take the honour. What is 610
       it? dispense with trifles; what is it?

     * Mistress Ford. If I would but go to hell for an eternal moment or
       so,
       I could be knighted.

     * Mistress Page. What? thou liest! Sir Alice Ford! These knights
       will hack; and so thou shouldst not alter the 615
       article of thy gentry.

     * Mistress Ford. We burn daylight: here, read, read; perceive how I
       might be knighted. I shall think the worse of fat
       men, as long as I have an eye to make difference of
       men's liking: and yet he would not swear; praised 620
       women's modesty; and gave such orderly and
       well-behaved reproof to all uncomeliness, that I
       would have sworn his disposition would have gone to
       the truth of his words; but they do no more adhere
       and keep place together than the Hundredth Psalm to 625
       the tune of 'Green Sleeves.' What tempest, I trow,
       threw this whale, with so many tuns of oil in his
       belly, ashore at Windsor? How shall I be revenged
       on him? I think the best way were to entertain him
       with hope, till the wicked fire of lust have melted 630
       him in his own grease. Did you ever hear the like?

     * Mistress Page. Letter for letter, but that the name of Page and
       Ford differs! To thy great comfort in this mystery
       of ill opinions, here's the twin-brother of thy
       letter: but let thine inherit first; for, I 635
       protest, mine never shall. I warrant he hath a
       thousand of these letters, writ with blank space for
       different names—sure, more,—and these are of the
       second edition: he will print them, out of doubt;
       for he cares not what he puts into the press, when 640
       he would put us two. I had rather be a giantess,
       and lie under Mount Pelion. Well, I will find you
       twenty lascivious turtles ere one chaste man.

     * Mistress Ford. Why, this is the very same; the very hand, the very
       words. What doth he think of us? 645

     * Mistress Page. Nay, I know not: it makes me almost ready to
       wrangle with mine own honesty. I'll entertain
       myself like one that I am not acquainted withal;
       for, sure, unless he know some strain in me, that I
       know not myself, he would never have boarded me in this fury. 650

     * Mistress Ford. 'Boarding,' call you it? I'll be sure to keep him
       above deck.

     * Mistress Page. So will I. if he come under my hatches, I'll never
       to sea again. Let's be revenged on him: let's
       appoint him a meeting; give him a show of comfort in 655
       his suit and lead him on with a fine-baited delay,
       till he hath pawned his horses to mine host of the Garter.

     * Mistress Ford. Nay, I will consent to act any villany against him,
       that may not sully the chariness of our honesty. O,
       that my husband saw this letter! it would give 660
       eternal food to his jealousy.

     * Mistress Page. Why, look where he comes; and my good man too: he's
       as far from jealousy as I am from giving him cause;
       and that I hope is an unmeasurable distance.

     * Mistress Ford. You are the happier woman. 665

     * Mistress Page. Let's consult together against this greasy knight.
       Come hither.

   [They retire]

   [Enter FORD with PISTOL, and PAGE with NYM]
     * Ford. Well, I hope it be not so. 670

     * Pistol. Hope is a curtal dog in some affairs:
       Sir John affects thy wife.

     * Ford. Why, sir, my wife is not young.

     * Pistol. He wooes both high and low, both rich and poor,
       Both young and old, one with another, Ford; 675
       He loves the gallimaufry: Ford, perpend.

     * Ford. Love my wife!

     * Pistol. With liver burning hot. Prevent, or go thou,
       Like Sir Actaeon he, with Ringwood at thy heels:
       O, odious is the name! 680

     * Ford. What name, sir?

     * Pistol. The horn, I say. Farewell.
       Take heed, have open eye, for thieves do foot by night:
       Take heed, ere summer comes or cuckoo-birds do sing.
       Away, Sir Corporal Nym! 685
       Believe it, Page; he speaks sense.

   [Exit]
     * Ford. [Aside] I will be patient; I will find out this.

     * Nym. [To PAGE] And this is true; I like not the humour
       of lying. He hath wronged me in some humours: I 690
       should have borne the humoured letter to her; but I
       have a sword and it shall bite upon my necessity.
       He loves your wife; there's the short and the long.
       My name is Corporal Nym; I speak and I avouch; 'tis
       true: my name is Nym and Falstaff loves your wife. 695
       Adieu. I love not the humour of bread and cheese,
       and there's the humour of it. Adieu.

   [Exit]
     * Page. 'The humour of it,' quoth a'! here's a fellow
       frights English out of his wits. 700

     * Ford. I will seek out Falstaff.

     * Page. I never heard such a drawling, affecting rogue.

     * Ford. If I do find it: well.

     * Page. I will not believe such a Cataian, though the priest
       o' the town commended him for a true man. 705

     * Ford. 'Twas a good sensible fellow: well.

     * Page. How now, Meg!

   [MISTRESS PAGE and MISTRESS FORD come forward]
     * Mistress Page. Whither go you, George? Hark you.

     * Mistress Ford. How now, sweet Frank! why art thou melancholy? 710

     * Ford. I melancholy! I am not melancholy. Get you home, go.

     * Mistress Ford. Faith, thou hast some crotchets in thy head. Now,
       will you go, Mistress Page?

     * Mistress Page. Have with you. You'll come to dinner, George.
       [Aside to MISTRESS FORD] 715
       Look who comes yonder: she shall be our messenger
       to this paltry knight.

     * Mistress Ford. [Aside to MISTRESS PAGE] Trust me, I thought on her:
       she'll fit it.

   [Enter MISTRESS QUICKLY]
     * Mistress Page. You are come to see my daughter Anne?

     * Hostess Quickly. Ay, forsooth; and, I pray, how does good Mistress
       Anne?

     * Mistress Page. Go in with us and see: we have an hour's talk with
       you.

   [Exeunt MISTRESS PAGE, MISTRESS FORD, and MISTRESS QUICKLY]
     * Page. How now, Master Ford!

     * Ford. You heard what this knave told me, did you not?

     * Page. Yes: and you heard what the other told me?

     * Ford. Do you think there is truth in them?

     * Page. Hang 'em, slaves! I do not think the knight would 730
       offer it: but these that accuse him in his intent
       towards our wives are a yoke of his discarded men;
       very rogues, now they be out of service.

     * Ford. Were they his men?

     * Page. Marry, were they. 735

     * Ford. I like it never the better for that. Does he lie at
       the Garter?

     * Page. Ay, marry, does he. If he should intend this voyage
       towards my wife, I would turn her loose to him; and
       what he gets more of her than sharp words, let it 740
       lie on my head.

     * Ford. I do not misdoubt my wife; but I would be loath to
       turn them together. A man may be too confident: I
       would have nothing lie on my head: I cannot be thus satisfied.

     * Page. Look where my ranting host of the Garter comes: 745
       there is either liquor in his pate or money in his
       purse when he looks so merrily.
       [Enter Host]
       How now, mine host!

     * Host. How now, bully-rook! thou'rt a gentleman. 750
       Cavaleiro-justice, I say!

   [Enter SHALLOW]
     * Robert Shallow. I follow, mine host, I follow. Good even and
       twenty, good Master Page! Master Page, will you go
       with us? we have sport in hand. 755

     * Host. Tell him, cavaleiro-justice; tell him, bully-rook.

     * Robert Shallow. Sir, there is a fray to be fought between Sir Hugh
       the Welsh priest and Caius the French doctor.

     * Ford. Good mine host o' the Garter, a word with you.

   [Drawing him aside]
     * Host. What sayest thou, my bully-rook?

     * Robert Shallow. [To PAGE] Will you go with us to behold it? My
       merry host hath had the measuring of their weapons;
       and, I think, hath appointed them contrary places;
       for, believe me, I hear the parson is no jester. 765
       Hark, I will tell you what our sport shall be.

   [They converse apart]
     * Host. Hast thou no suit against my knight, my
       guest-cavaleire?

     * Ford. None, I protest: but I'll give you a pottle of 770
       burnt sack to give me recourse to him and tell him
       my name is Brook; only for a jest.

     * Host. My hand, bully; thou shalt have egress and regress;
       —said I well?—and thy name shall be Brook. It is
       a merry knight. Will you go, An-heires? 775

     * Robert Shallow. Have with you, mine host.

     * Page. I have heard the Frenchman hath good skill in
       his rapier.

     * Robert Shallow. Tut, sir, I could have told you more. In these
       times
       you stand on distance, your passes, stoccadoes, and 780
       I know not what: 'tis the heart, Master Page; 'tis
       here, 'tis here. I have seen the time, with my long
       sword I would have made you four tall fellows skip like rats.

     * Host. Here, boys, here, here! shall we wag?

     * Page. Have with you. I would rather hear them scold than fight. 785

   [Exeunt Host, SHALLOW, and PAGE]
     * Ford. Though Page be a secure fool, an stands so firmly
       on his wife's frailty, yet I cannot put off my
       opinion so easily: she was in his company at Page's
       house; and what they made there, I know not. Well, 790
       I will look further into't: and I have a disguise
       to sound Falstaff. If I find her honest, I lose not
       my labour; if she be otherwise, 'tis labour well bestowed.

   Act II, Scene 2

   A room in the Garter Inn.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   [Enter FALSTAFF and PISTOL]
     * Falstaff. I will not lend thee a penny.

     * Pistol. Why, then the world's mine oyster.
       Which I with sword will open.

     * Falstaff. Not a penny. I have been content, sir, you should
       lay my countenance to pawn; I have grated upon my 800
       good friends for three reprieves for you and your
       coach-fellow Nym; or else you had looked through
       the grate, like a geminy of baboons. I am damned in
       hell for swearing to gentlemen my friends, you were
       good soldiers and tall fellows; and when Mistress 805
       Bridget lost the handle of her fan, I took't upon
       mine honour thou hadst it not.

     * Pistol. Didst not thou share? hadst thou not fifteen pence?

     * Falstaff. Reason, you rogue, reason: thinkest thou I'll
       endanger my soul gratis? At a word, hang no more 810
       about me, I am no gibbet for you. Go. A short knife
       and a throng! To your manor of Pickt-hatch! Go.
       You'll not bear a letter for me, you rogue! you
       stand upon your honour! Why, thou unconfinable
       baseness, it is as much as I can do to keep the 815
       terms of my honour precise: I, I, I myself
       sometimes, leaving the fear of God on the left hand
       and hiding mine honour in my necessity, am fain to
       shuffle, to hedge and to lurch; and yet you, rogue,
       will ensconce your rags, your cat-a-mountain 820
       looks, your red-lattice phrases, and your
       bold-beating oaths, under the shelter of your
       honour! You will not do it, you!

     * Pistol. I do relent: what would thou more of man?

   [Enter ROBIN]
     * Robin. Sir, here's a woman would speak with you.

     * Falstaff. Let her approach.

   [Enter MISTRESS QUICKLY]
     * Hostess Quickly. Give your worship good morrow.

     * Falstaff. Good morrow, good wife. 830

     * Hostess Quickly. Not so, an't please your worship.

     * Falstaff. Good maid, then.

     * Hostess Quickly. I'll be sworn,
       As my mother was, the first hour I was born.

     * Falstaff. I do believe the swearer. What with me? 835

     * Hostess Quickly. Shall I vouchsafe your worship a word or two?

     * Falstaff. Two thousand, fair woman: and I'll vouchsafe thee
       the hearing.

     * Hostess Quickly. There is one Mistress Ford, sir:—I pray, come a
       little nearer this ways:—I myself dwell with master 840
       Doctor Caius,—

     * Falstaff. Well, on: Mistress Ford, you say,—

     * Hostess Quickly. Your worship says very true: I pray your worship,
       come a little nearer this ways.

     * Falstaff. I warrant thee, nobody hears; mine own people, mine 845
       own people.

     * Hostess Quickly. Are they so? God bless them and make them his
       servants!

     * Falstaff. Well, Mistress Ford; what of her?

     * Hostess Quickly. Why, sir, she's a good creature. Lord Lord! your
       worship's a wanton! Well, heaven forgive you and all 850
       of us, I pray!

     * Falstaff. Mistress Ford; come, Mistress Ford,—

     * Hostess Quickly. Marry, this is the short and the long of it; you
       have brought her into such a canaries as 'tis
       wonderful. The best courtier of them all, when the 855
       court lay at Windsor, could never have brought her
       to such a canary. Yet there has been knights, and
       lords, and gentlemen, with their coaches, I warrant
       you, coach after coach, letter after letter, gift
       after gift; smelling so sweetly, all musk, and so 860
       rushling, I warrant you, in silk and gold; and in
       such alligant terms; and in such wine and sugar of
       the best and the fairest, that would have won any
       woman's heart; and, I warrant you, they could never
       get an eye-wink of her: I had myself twenty angels 865
       given me this morning; but I defy all angels, in
       any such sort, as they say, but in the way of
       honesty: and, I warrant you, they could never get
       her so much as sip on a cup with the proudest of
       them all: and yet there has been earls, nay, which 870
       is more, pensioners; but, I warrant you, all is one with her.

     * Falstaff. But what says she to me? be brief, my good
       she-Mercury.

     * Hostess Quickly. Marry, she hath received your letter, for the
       which
       she thanks you a thousand times; and she gives you 875
       to notify that her husband will be absence from his
       house between ten and eleven.

     * Falstaff. Ten and eleven?

     * Hostess Quickly. Ay, forsooth; and then you may come and see the
       picture, she says, that you wot of: Master Ford, 880
       her husband, will be from home. Alas! the sweet
       woman leads an ill life with him: he's a very
       jealousy man: she leads a very frampold life with
       him, good heart.

     * Falstaff. Ten and eleven. Woman, commend me to her; I will 885
       not fail her.

     * Hostess Quickly. Why, you say well. But I have another messenger to
       your worship. Mistress Page hath her hearty
       commendations to you too: and let me tell you in
       your ear, she's as fartuous a civil modest wife, and 890
       one, I tell you, that will not miss you morning nor
       evening prayer, as any is in Windsor, whoe'er be the
       other: and she bade me tell your worship that her
       husband is seldom from home; but she hopes there
       will come a time. I never knew a woman so dote upon 895
       a man: surely I think you have charms, la; yes, in truth.

     * Falstaff. Not I, I assure thee: setting the attractions of my
       good parts aside I have no other charms.

     * Hostess Quickly. Blessing on your heart for't!

     * Falstaff. But, I pray thee, tell me this: has Ford's wife and 900
       Page's wife acquainted each other how they love me?

     * Hostess Quickly. That were a jest indeed! they have not so little
       grace, I hope: that were a trick indeed! but
       Mistress Page would desire you to send her your
       little page, of all loves: her husband has a 905
       marvellous infection to the little page; and truly
       Master Page is an honest man. Never a wife in
       Windsor leads a better life than she does: do what
       she will, say what she will, take all, pay all, go
       to bed when she list, rise when she list, all is as 910
       she will: and truly she deserves it; for if there
       be a kind woman in Windsor, she is one. You must
       send her your page; no remedy.

     * Falstaff. Why, I will.

     * Hostess Quickly. Nay, but do so, then: and, look you, he may come
       and 915
       go between you both; and in any case have a
       nay-word, that you may know one another's mind, and
       the boy never need to understand any thing; for
       'tis not good that children should know any
       wickedness: old folks, you know, have discretion, 920
       as they say, and know the world.

     * Falstaff. Fare thee well: commend me to them both: there's
       my purse; I am yet thy debtor. Boy, go along with
       this woman.
       [Exeunt MISTRESS QUICKLY and ROBIN] 925
       This news distracts me!

     * Pistol. This punk is one of Cupid's carriers:
       Clap on more sails; pursue; up with your fights:
       Give fire: she is my prize, or ocean whelm them all!

   [Exit]
     * Falstaff. Sayest thou so, old Jack? go thy ways; I'll make
       more of thy old body than I have done. Will they
       yet look after thee? Wilt thou, after the expense
       of so much money, be now a gainer? Good body, I
       thank thee. Let them say 'tis grossly done; so it be 935
       fairly done, no matter.

   [Enter BARDOLPH]
     * Bardolph. Sir John, there's one Master Brook below would fain
       speak with you, and be acquainted with you; and hath
       sent your worship a morning's draught of sack. 940

     * Falstaff. Brook is his name?

     * Bardolph. Ay, sir.

     * Falstaff. Call him in.
       [Exit BARDOLPH]
       Such Brooks are welcome to me, that o'erflow such 945
       liquor. Ah, ha! Mistress Ford and Mistress Page
       have I encompassed you? go to; via!

   [Re-enter BARDOLPH, with FORD disguised]
     * Ford. Bless you, sir!

     * Falstaff. And you, sir! Would you speak with me? 950

     * Ford. I make bold to press with so little preparation upon
       you.

     * Falstaff. You're welcome. What's your will? Give us leave, drawer.

   [Exit BARDOLPH]
     * Ford. Sir, I am a gentleman that have spent much; my name is Brook.
       955

     * Falstaff. Good Master Brook, I desire more acquaintance of you.

     * Ford. Good Sir John, I sue for yours: not to charge you;
       for I must let you understand I think myself in
       better plight for a lender than you are: the which
       hath something embolden'd me to this unseasoned 960
       intrusion; for they say, if money go before, all
       ways do lie open.

     * Falstaff. Money is a good soldier, sir, and will on.

     * Ford. Troth, and I have a bag of money here troubles me:
       if you will help to bear it, Sir John, take all, or 965
       half, for easing me of the carriage.

     * Falstaff. Sir, I know not how I may deserve to be your porter.

     * Ford. I will tell you, sir, if you will give me the hearing.

     * Falstaff. Speak, good Master Brook: I shall be glad to be
       your servant. 970

     * Ford. Sir, I hear you are a scholar,—I will be brief
       with you,—and you have been a man long known to me,
       though I had never so good means, as desire, to make
       myself acquainted with you. I shall discover a
       thing to you, wherein I must very much lay open mine 975
       own imperfection: but, good Sir John, as you have
       one eye upon my follies, as you hear them unfolded,
       turn another into the register of your own; that I
       may pass with a reproof the easier, sith you
       yourself know how easy it is to be such an offender. 980

     * Falstaff. Very well, sir; proceed.

     * Ford. There is a gentlewoman in this town; her husband's
       name is Ford.

     * Falstaff. Well, sir.

     * Ford. I have long loved her, and, I protest to you, 985
       bestowed much on her; followed her with a doting
       observance; engrossed opportunities to meet her;
       fee'd every slight occasion that could but niggardly
       give me sight of her; not only bought many presents
       to give her, but have given largely to many to know 990
       what she would have given; briefly, I have pursued
       her as love hath pursued me; which hath been on the
       wing of all occasions. But whatsoever I have
       merited, either in my mind or, in my means, meed,
       I am sure, I have received none; unless experience 995
       be a jewel that I have purchased at an infinite
       rate, and that hath taught me to say this:
       'Love like a shadow flies when substance love pursues;
       Pursuing that that flies, and flying what pursues.'

     * Falstaff. Have you received no promise of satisfaction at her
       hands? 1000

     * Ford. Never.

     * Falstaff. Have you importuned her to such a purpose?

     * Ford. Never.

     * Falstaff. Of what quality was your love, then?

     * Ford. Like a fair house built on another man's ground; so 1005
       that I have lost my edifice by mistaking the place
       where I erected it.

     * Falstaff. To what purpose have you unfolded this to me?

     * Ford. When I have told you that, I have told you all.
       Some say, that though she appear honest to me, yet in 1010
       other places she enlargeth her mirth so far that
       there is shrewd construction made of her. Now, Sir
       John, here is the heart of my purpose: you are a
       gentleman of excellent breeding, admirable
       discourse, of great admittance, authentic in your 1015
       place and person, generally allowed for your many
       war-like, court-like, and learned preparations.

     * Falstaff. O, sir!

     * Ford. Believe it, for you know it. There is money; spend
       it, spend it; spend more; spend all I have; only 1020
       give me so much of your time in exchange of it, as
       to lay an amiable siege to the honesty of this
       Ford's wife: use your art of wooing; win her to
       consent to you: if any man may, you may as soon as
       any. 1025

     * Falstaff. Would it apply well to the vehemency of your
       affection, that I should win what you would enjoy?
       Methinks you prescribe to yourself very preposterously.

     * Ford. O, understand my drift. She dwells so securely on
       the excellency of her honour, that the folly of my 1030
       soul dares not present itself: she is too bright to
       be looked against. Now, could I could come to her
       with any detection in my hand, my desires had
       instance and argument to commend themselves: I
       could drive her then from the ward of her purity, 1035
       her reputation, her marriage-vow, and a thousand
       other her defences, which now are too too strongly
       embattled against me. What say you to't, Sir John?

     * Falstaff. Master Brook, I will first make bold with your
       money; next, give me your hand; and last, as I am a 1040
       gentleman, you shall, if you will, enjoy Ford's wife.

     * Ford. O good sir!

     * Falstaff. I say you shall.

     * Ford. Want no money, Sir John; you shall want none.

     * Falstaff. Want no Mistress Ford, Master Brook; you shall want 1045
       none. I shall be with her, I may tell you, by her
       own appointment; even as you came in to me, her
       assistant or go-between parted from me: I say I
       shall be with her between ten and eleven; for at
       that time the jealous rascally knave her husband 1050
       will be forth. Come you to me at night; you shall
       know how I speed.

     * Ford. I am blest in your acquaintance. Do you know Ford,
       sir?

     * Falstaff. Hang him, poor cuckoldly knave! I know him not: 1055
       yet I wrong him to call him poor; they say the
       jealous wittolly knave hath masses of money; for the
       which his wife seems to me well-favored. I will
       use her as the key of the cuckoldly rogue's coffer;
       and there's my harvest-home. 1060

     * Ford. I would you knew Ford, sir, that you might avoid him
       if you saw him.

     * Falstaff. Hang him, mechanical salt-butter rogue! I will
       stare him out of his wits; I will awe him with my
       cudgel: it shall hang like a meteor o'er the 1065
       cuckold's horns. Master Brook, thou shalt know I
       will predominate over the peasant, and thou shalt
       lie with his wife. Come to me soon at night.
       Ford's a knave, and I will aggravate his style;
       thou, Master Brook, shalt know him for knave and 1070
       cuckold. Come to me soon at night.

   [Exit]
     * Ford. What a damned Epicurean rascal is this! My heart is
       ready to crack with impatience. Who says this is
       improvident jealousy? my wife hath sent to him; the 1075
       hour is fixed; the match is made. Would any man
       have thought this? See the hell of having a false
       woman! My bed shall be abused, my coffers
       ransacked, my reputation gnawn at; and I shall not
       only receive this villanous wrong, but stand under 1080
       the adoption of abominable terms, and by him that
       does me this wrong. Terms! names! Amaimon sounds
       well; Lucifer, well; Barbason, well; yet they are
       devils' additions, the names of fiends: but
       Cuckold! Wittol!—Cuckold! the devil himself hath 1085
       not such a name. Page is an ass, a secure ass: he
       will trust his wife; he will not be jealous. I will
       rather trust a Fleming with my butter, Parson Hugh
       the Welshman with my cheese, an Irishman with my
       aqua-vitae bottle, or a thief to walk my ambling 1090
       gelding, than my wife with herself; then she plots,
       then she ruminates, then she devises; and what they
       think in their hearts they may effect, they will
       break their hearts but they will effect. God be
       praised for my jealousy! Eleven o'clock the hour. 1095
       I will prevent this, detect my wife, be revenged on
       Falstaff, and laugh at Page. I will about it;
       better three hours too soon than a minute too late.
       Fie, fie, fie! cuckold! cuckold! cuckold!

       Is it not true, Master Page?

     * Page. Master Shallow, you have yourself been a great
       fighter, though now a man of peace.

       Caius, I am come to fetch you home. I am sworn of

     * Host. And I will provoke him to't, or let him wag.

     * Doctor Caius. Me tank you for dat.

     * Host. And, moreover, bully,—but first, master guest, and
       Master Page, and eke Cavaleiro Slender, go you 1165
       through the town to Frogmore.

   [Aside to them]
     * Page. Sir Hugh is there, is he?

     * Host. He is there: see what humour he is in; and I will
       bring the doctor about by the fields. Will it do well? 1170

     * Robert Shallow. We will do it.

     * Page. [with Shallow and Slender] Adieu, good master doctor.

   [Exeunt PAGE, SHALLOW, and SLENDER]
     * Doctor Caius. By gar, me vill kill de priest; for he speak for a
       jack-an-ape to Anne Page. 1175

     * Host. Let him die: sheathe thy impatience, throw cold
       water on thy choler: go about the fields with me
       through Frogmore: I will bring thee where Mistress
       Anne Page is, at a farm-house a-feasting; and thou
       shalt woo her. Cried I aim? said I well? 1180

     * Doctor Caius. By gar, me dank you for dat: by gar, I love you;
       and I shall procure-a you de good guest, de earl,
       de knight, de lords, de gentlemen, my patients.

     * Host. For the which I will be thy adversary toward Anne
       Page. Said I well? 1185

     * Doctor Caius. By gar, 'tis good; vell said.

     * Host. Let us wag, then.

     * Doctor Caius. Come at my heels, Jack Rugby.

   A field near Frogmore.

   [Enter SIR HUGH EVANS and SIMPLE]
     * Sir Hugh Evans. I pray you now, good master Slender's serving-man,
       and friend Simple by your name, which way have you
       looked for Master Caius, that calls himself doctor of physic?

     * Simple. Marry, sir, the pittie-ward, the park-ward, every
       way; old Windsor way, and every way but the town 1195
       way.

     * Sir Hugh Evans. I most fehemently desire you you will also look
       that
       way.

     * Simple. I will, sir.

   [Exit]
     * Sir Hugh Evans. 'Pless my soul, how full of chollors I am, and
       trempling of mind! I shall be glad if he have
       deceived me. How melancholies I am! I will knog
       his urinals about his knave's costard when I have
       good opportunities for the ork. 'Pless my soul! 1205
       [Sings]
       To shallow rivers, to whose falls
       Melodious birds sings madrigals;
       There will we make our peds of roses,
       And a thousand fragrant posies. 1210
       To shallow—
       Mercy on me! I have a great dispositions to cry.
       [Sings]
       Melodious birds sing madrigals—
       When as I sat in Pabylon— 1215
       And a thousand vagram posies.
       To shallow &c.

   [Re-enter SIMPLE]
     * Simple. Yonder he is coming, this way, Sir Hugh.

     * Sir Hugh Evans. He's welcome. 1220
       [Sings]
       To shallow rivers, to whose falls-
       Heaven prosper the right! What weapons is he?

     * Simple. No weapons, sir. There comes my master, Master
       Shallow, and another gentleman, from Frogmore, over 1225
       the stile, this way.

     * Sir Hugh Evans. Pray you, give me my gown; or else keep it in your
       arms.

   [Enter PAGE, SHALLOW, and SLENDER]
     * Robert Shallow. How now, master Parson! Good morrow, good Sir Hugh.
       Keep a gamester from the dice, and a good student 1230
       from his book, and it is wonderful.

     * Slender. [Aside] Ah, sweet Anne Page!

     * Page. 'Save you, good Sir Hugh!

     * Sir Hugh Evans. 'Pless you from his mercy sake, all of you!

     * Robert Shallow. What, the sword and the word! do you study them
       1235
       both, master parson?

     * Page. And youthful still! in your doublet and hose this
       raw rheumatic day!

     * Sir Hugh Evans. There is reasons and causes for it.

     * Page. We are come to you to do a good office, master parson. 1240

     * Sir Hugh Evans. Fery well: what is it?

     * Page. Yonder is a most reverend gentleman, who, belike
       having received wrong by some person, is at most
       odds with his own gravity and patience that ever you
       saw. 1245

     * Robert Shallow. I have lived fourscore years and upward; I never
       heard a man of his place, gravity and learning, so
       wide of his own respect.

     * Sir Hugh Evans. What is he?

     * Page. I think you know him; Master Doctor Caius, the 1250
       renowned French physician.

     * Sir Hugh Evans. Got's will, and his passion of my heart! I had as
       lief you would tell me of a mess of porridge.

     * Page. Why?

     * Sir Hugh Evans. He has no more knowledge in Hibocrates and Galen,
       1255
       —and he is a knave besides; a cowardly knave as you
       would desires to be acquainted withal.

     * Page. I warrant you, he's the man should fight with him.

     * Robert Shallow. [Aside] O sweet Anne Page!

     * Robert Shallow. It appears so by his weapons. Keep them asunder:
       1260
       here comes Doctor Caius.

   [Enter Host, DOCTOR CAIUS, and RUGBY]
     * Page. Nay, good master parson, keep in your weapon.

     * Robert Shallow. So do you, good master doctor.

     * Host. Disarm them, and let them question: let them keep 1265
       their limbs whole and hack our English.

     * Doctor Caius. I pray you, let-a me speak a word with your ear.
       Vherefore vill you not meet-a me?

     * Sir Hugh Evans. [Aside to DOCTOR CAIUS] Pray you, use your
       patience:
       in good time. 1270

     * Doctor Caius. By gar, you are de coward, de Jack dog, John ape.

     * Sir Hugh Evans. [Aside to DOCTOR CAIUS] Pray you let us not be
       laughing-stocks to other men's humours; I desire you
       in friendship, and I will one way or other make you amends.
       [Aloud] 1275
       I will knog your urinals about your knave's cockscomb
       for missing your meetings and appointments.

     * Doctor Caius. Diable! Jack Rugby,—mine host de Jarteer,—have I
       not stay for him to kill him? have I not, at de place
       I did appoint? 1280

     * Sir Hugh Evans. As I am a Christians soul now, look you, this is
       the
       place appointed: I'll be judgement by mine host of
       the Garter.

     * Host. Peace, I say, Gallia and Gaul, French and Welsh,
       soul-curer and body-curer! 1285

     * Doctor Caius. Ay, dat is very good; excellent.

     * Host. Peace, I say! hear mine host of the Garter. Am I
       politic? am I subtle? am I a Machiavel? Shall I
       lose my doctor? no; he gives me the potions and the
       motions. Shall I lose my parson, my priest, my Sir 1290
       Hugh? no; he gives me the proverbs and the
       no-verbs. Give me thy hand, terrestrial; so. Give me
       thy hand, celestial; so. Boys of art, I have
       deceived you both; I have directed you to wrong
       places: your hearts are mighty, your skins are 1295
       whole, and let burnt sack be the issue. Come, lay
       their swords to pawn. Follow me, lads of peace;
       follow, follow, follow.

     * Robert Shallow. Trust me, a mad host. Follow, gentlemen, follow.

     * Slender. [Aside] O sweet Anne Page! 1300

   [Exeunt SHALLOW, SLENDER, PAGE, and Host]
     * Doctor Caius. Ha, do I perceive dat? have you make-a de sot of
       us, ha, ha?

     * Sir Hugh Evans. This is well; he has made us his vlouting-stog. I
       desire you that we may be friends; and let us knog 1305
       our prains together to be revenge on this same
       scall, scurvy cogging companion, the host of the Garter.

     * Doctor Caius. By gar, with all my heart. He promise to bring me
       where is Anne Page; by gar, he deceive me too.

     * Sir Hugh Evans. Well, I will smite his noddles. Pray you, follow.
       1310

   Act III, Scene 2

   A street.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   [Enter MISTRESS PAGE and ROBIN]
     * Mistress Page. Nay, keep your way, little gallant; you were wont to
       be a follower, but now you are a leader. Whether
       had you rather lead mine eyes, or eye your master's heels? 1315

     * Robin. I had rather, forsooth, go before you like a man
       than follow him like a dwarf.

     * Mistress Page. O, you are a flattering boy: now I see you'll be a
       courtier.

   [Enter FORD]
     * Ford. Well met, Mistress Page. Whither go you? 1320

     * Mistress Page. Truly, sir, to see your wife. Is she at home?

     * Ford. Ay; and as idle as she may hang together, for want
       of company. I think, if your husbands were dead,
       you two would marry.

     * Mistress Page. Be sure of that,—two other husbands. 1325

     * Ford. Where had you this pretty weather-cock?

     * Mistress Page. I cannot tell what the dickens his name is my
       husband had him of. What do you call your knight's
       name, sirrah?

     * Robin. Sir John Falstaff. 1330

     * Ford. Sir John Falstaff!

     * Mistress Page. He, he; I can never hit on's name. There is such a
       league between my good man and he! Is your wife at
       home indeed?

     * Ford. Indeed she is. 1335

     * Mistress Page. By your leave, sir: I am sick till I see her.

   [Exeunt MISTRESS PAGE and ROBIN]
     * Ford. Has Page any brains? hath he any eyes? hath he any
       thinking? Sure, they sleep; he hath no use of them.
       Why, this boy will carry a letter twenty mile, as 1340
       easy as a cannon will shoot point-blank twelve
       score. He pieces out his wife's inclination; he
       gives her folly motion and advantage: and now she's
       going to my wife, and Falstaff's boy with her. A
       man may hear this shower sing in the wind. And 1345
       Falstaff's boy with her! Good plots, they are laid;
       and our revolted wives share damnation together.
       Well; I will take him, then torture my wife, pluck
       the borrowed veil of modesty from the so seeming
       Mistress Page, divulge Page himself for a secure and 1350
       wilful Actaeon; and to these violent proceedings all
       my neighbours shall cry aim.
       [Clock heard]
       The clock gives me my cue, and my assurance bids me
       search: there I shall find Falstaff: I shall be 1355
       rather praised for this than mocked; for it is as
       positive as the earth is firm that Falstaff is
       there: I will go.
       [Enter PAGE, SHALLOW, SLENDER, Host,]
       SIR HUGH EVANS, DOCTOR CAIUS, and RUGBY] 1360

     * Robert Shallow. [with Page and others] Well met, Master Ford.

     * Ford. Trust me, a good knot: I have good cheer at home;
       and I pray you all go with me.

     * Robert Shallow. I must excuse myself, Master Ford.

     * Slender. And so must I, sir: we have appointed to dine with 1365
       Mistress Anne, and I would not break with her for
       more money than I'll speak of.

     * Robert Shallow. We have lingered about a match between Anne Page
       and
       my cousin Slender, and this day we shall have our answer.

     * Slender. I hope I have your good will, father Page. 1370

     * Page. You have, Master Slender; I stand wholly for you:
       but my wife, master doctor, is for you altogether.

     * Doctor Caius. Ay, be-gar; and de maid is love-a me: my nursh-a
       Quickly tell me so mush.

     * Host. What say you to young Master Fenton? he capers, he 1375
       dances, he has eyes of youth, he writes verses, he
       speaks holiday, he smells April and May: he will
       carry't, he will carry't; 'tis in his buttons; he
       will carry't.

     * Page. Not by my consent, I promise you. The gentleman is 1380
       of no having: he kept company with the wild prince
       and Poins; he is of too high a region; he knows too
       much. No, he shall not knit a knot in his fortunes
       with the finger of my substance: if he take her,
       let him take her simply; the wealth I have waits on 1385
       my consent, and my consent goes not that way.

     * Ford. I beseech you heartily, some of you go home with me
       to dinner: besides your cheer, you shall have
       sport; I will show you a monster. Master doctor,
       you shall go; so shall you, Master Page; and you, Sir Hugh. 1390

     * Robert Shallow. Well, fare you well: we shall have the freer wooing
       at Master Page's.

   [Exeunt SHALLOW, and SLENDER]
     * Doctor Caius. Go home, John Rugby; I come anon.

   [Exit RUGBY]
     * Host. Farewell, my hearts: I will to my honest knight
       Falstaff, and drink canary with him.

   [Exit]
     * Ford. [Aside] I think I shall drink in pipe wine first
       with him; I'll make him dance. Will you go, gentles? 1400

     * All. Have with you to see this monster.

   [Exeunt]

   Act III, Scene 3

   A room in FORD’S house.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   [Enter MISTRESS FORD and MISTRESS PAGE]
     * Mistress Ford. What, John! What, Robert!

     * Mistress Page. Quickly, quickly! is the buck-basket— 1405

     * Mistress Ford. I warrant. What, Robin, I say!

   [Enter Servants with a basket]
     * Mistress Page. Come, come, come.

     * Mistress Ford. Here, set it down.

     * Mistress Page. Give your men the charge; we must be brief. 1410

     * Mistress Ford. Marry, as I told you before, John and Robert, be
       ready here hard by in the brew-house: and when I
       suddenly call you, come forth, and without any pause
       or staggering take this basket on your shoulders:
       that done, trudge with it in all haste, and carry 1415
       it among the whitsters in Datchet-mead, and there
       empty it in the muddy ditch close by the Thames side.

     * Mistress Page. You will do it?

     * Mistress Ford. I ha' told them over and over; they lack no
       direction. Be gone, and come when you are called. 1420

   [Exeunt Servants]
     * Mistress Page. Here comes little Robin.

   [Enter ROBIN]
     * Mistress Ford. How now, my eyas-musket! what news with you?

     * Robin. My master, Sir John, is come in at your back-door, 1425
       Mistress Ford, and requests your company.

     * Mistress Page. You little Jack-a-Lent, have you been true to us?

     * Robin. Ay, I'll be sworn. My master knows not of your
       being here and hath threatened to put me into
       everlasting liberty if I tell you of it; for he 1430
       swears he'll turn me away.

     * Mistress Page. Thou'rt a good boy: this secrecy of thine shall be
       a tailor to thee and shall make thee a new doublet
       and hose. I'll go hide me.

     * Mistress Ford. Do so. Go tell thy master I am alone. 1435
       [Exit ROBIN]
       Mistress Page, remember you your cue.

     * Mistress Page. I warrant thee; if I do not act it, hiss me.

   [Exit]
     * Mistress Ford. Go to, then: we'll use this unwholesome humidity,
       1440
       this gross watery pumpion; we'll teach him to know
       turtles from jays.

   [Enter FALSTAFF]
     * Falstaff. Have I caught thee, my heavenly jewel? Why, now let
       me die, for I have lived long enough: this is the 1445
       period of my ambition: O this blessed hour!

     * Mistress Ford. O sweet Sir John!

     * Falstaff. Mistress Ford, I cannot cog, I cannot prate,
       Mistress Ford. Now shall I sin in my wish: I would
       thy husband were dead: I'll speak it before the 1450
       best lord; I would make thee my lady.

     * Mistress Ford. I your lady, Sir John! alas, I should be a pitiful
       lady!

     * Falstaff. Let the court of France show me such another. I see
       how thine eye would emulate the diamond: thou hast
       the right arched beauty of the brow that becomes the 1455
       ship-tire, the tire-valiant, or any tire of
       Venetian admittance.

     * Mistress Ford. A plain kerchief, Sir John: my brows become nothing
       else; nor that well neither.

     * Falstaff. By the Lord, thou art a traitor to say so: thou 1460
       wouldst make an absolute courtier; and the firm
       fixture of thy foot would give an excellent motion
       to thy gait in a semi-circled farthingale. I see
       what thou wert, if Fortune thy foe were not, Nature
       thy friend. Come, thou canst not hide it. 1465

     * Mistress Ford. Believe me, there is no such thing in me.

     * Falstaff. What made me love thee? let that persuade thee
       there's something extraordinary in thee. Come, I
       cannot cog and say thou art this and that, like a
       many of these lisping hawthorn-buds, that come like 1470
       women in men's apparel, and smell like Bucklersbury
       in simple time; I cannot: but I love thee; none
       but thee; and thou deservest it.

     * Mistress Ford. Do not betray me, sir. I fear you love Mistress
       Page.

     * Falstaff. Thou mightst as well say I love to walk by the 1475
       Counter-gate, which is as hateful to me as the reek
       of a lime-kiln.

     * Mistress Ford. Well, heaven knows how I love you; and you shall one
       day find it.

     * Falstaff. Keep in that mind; I'll deserve it. 1480

     * Mistress Ford. Nay, I must tell you, so you do; or else I could not
       be in that mind.

     * Robin. [Within] Mistress Ford, Mistress Ford! here's
       Mistress Page at the door, sweating and blowing and
       looking wildly, and would needs speak with you presently. 1485

     * Falstaff. She shall not see me: I will ensconce me behind the
       arras.

     * Mistress Ford. Pray you, do so: she's a very tattling woman.
       [FALSTAFF hides himself]
       [Re-enter MISTRESS PAGE and ROBIN]
       What's the matter? how now! 1490

     * Mistress Page. O Mistress Ford, what have you done? You're shamed,
       you're overthrown, you're undone for ever!

     * Mistress Ford. What's the matter, good Mistress Page?

     * Mistress Page. O well-a-day, Mistress Ford! having an honest man
       to your husband, to give him such cause of suspicion! 1495

     * Mistress Ford. What cause of suspicion?

     * Mistress Page. What cause of suspicion! Out pon you! how am I
       mistook in you!

     * Mistress Ford. Why, alas, what's the matter?

     * Mistress Page. Your husband's coming hither, woman, with all the
       1500
       officers in Windsor, to search for a gentleman that
       he says is here now in the house by your consent, to
       take an ill advantage of his assence: you are undone.

     * Mistress Ford. 'Tis not so, I hope.

     * Mistress Page. Pray heaven it be not so, that you have such a man
       1505
       here! but 'tis most certain your husband's coming,
       with half Windsor at his heels, to search for such a
       one. I come before to tell you. If you know
       yourself clear, why, I am glad of it; but if you
       have a friend here convey, convey him out. Be not 1510
       amazed; call all your senses to you; defend your
       reputation, or bid farewell to your good life for ever.

     * Mistress Ford. What shall I do? There is a gentleman my dear
       friend; and I fear not mine own shame so much as his
       peril: I had rather than a thousand pound he were 1515
       out of the house.

     * Mistress Page. For shame! never stand 'you had rather' and 'you
       had rather:' your husband's here at hand, bethink
       you of some conveyance: in the house you cannot
       hide him. O, how have you deceived me! Look, here 1520
       is a basket: if he be of any reasonable stature, he
       may creep in here; and throw foul linen upon him, as
       if it were going to bucking: or—it is whiting-time
       —send him by your two men to Datchet-mead.

     * Mistress Ford. He's too big to go in there. What shall I do? 1525

     * Falstaff. [Coming forward] Let me see't, let me see't, O, let
       me see't! I'll in, I'll in. Follow your friend's
       counsel. I'll in.

     * Mistress Page. What, Sir John Falstaff! Are these your letters,
       knight?

     * Falstaff. I love thee. Help me away. Let me creep in here. 1530
       I'll never—

   [Gets into the basket; they cover him with foul linen]
     * Mistress Page. Help to cover your master, boy. Call your men,
       Mistress Ford. You dissembling knight!

     * Mistress Ford. What, John! Robert! John! 1535
       [Exit ROBIN]
       [Re-enter Servants]
       Go take up these clothes here quickly. Where's the
       cowl-staff? look, how you drumble! Carry them to
       the laundress in Datchet-meat; quickly, come. 1540

   [Enter FORD, PAGE, DOCTOR CAIUS, and SIR HUGH EVANS]
     * Ford. Pray you, come near: if I suspect without cause,
       why then make sport at me; then let me be your jest;
       I deserve it. How now! whither bear you this?

     * Servant. To the laundress, forsooth. 1545

     * Mistress Ford. Why, what have you to do whither they bear it? You
       were best meddle with buck-washing.

     * Ford. Buck! I would I could wash myself of the buck!
       Buck, buck, buck! Ay, buck; I warrant you, buck;
       and of the season too, it shall appear. 1550
       [Exeunt Servants with the basket]
       Gentlemen, I have dreamed to-night; I'll tell you my
       dream. Here, here, here be my keys: ascend my
       chambers; search, seek, find out: I'll warrant
       we'll unkennel the fox. Let me stop this way first. 1555
       [Locking the door]
       So, now uncape.

     * Page. Good Master Ford, be contented: you wrong yourself too much.

     * Ford. True, Master Page. Up, gentlemen: you shall see
       sport anon: follow me, gentlemen. 1560

   [Exit]
     * Sir Hugh Evans. This is fery fantastical humours and jealousies.

     * Doctor Caius. By gar, 'tis no the fashion of France; it is not
       jealous in France.

     * Page. Nay, follow him, gentlemen; see the issue of his search. 1565

   [Exeunt PAGE, DOCTOR CAIUS, and SIR HUGH EVANS]
     * Mistress Page. Is there not a double excellency in this?

     * Mistress Ford. I know not which pleases me better, that my husband
       is deceived, or Sir John.

     * Mistress Page. What a taking was he in when your husband asked who
       1570
       was in the basket!

     * Mistress Ford. I am half afraid he will have need of washing; so
       throwing him into the water will do him a benefit.

     * Mistress Page. Hang him, dishonest rascal! I would all of the same
       strain were in the same distress. 1575

     * Mistress Ford. I think my husband hath some special suspicion of
       Falstaff's being here; for I never saw him so gross
       in his jealousy till now.

     * Mistress Page. I will lay a plot to try that; and we will yet have
       more tricks with Falstaff: his dissolute disease will 1580
       scarce obey this medicine.

     * Mistress Ford. Shall we send that foolish carrion, Mistress
       Quickly, to him, and excuse his throwing into the
       water; and give him another hope, to betray him to
       another punishment? 1585

     * Mistress Page. We will do it: let him be sent for to-morrow,
       eight o'clock, to have amends.

   [Re-enter FORD, PAGE, DOCTOR CAIUS, and SIR HUGH EVANS]
     * Ford. I cannot find him: may be the knave bragged of that
       he could not compass. 1590

     * Mistress Page. [Aside to MISTRESS FORD] Heard you that?

     * Mistress Ford. You use me well, Master Ford, do you?

     * Ford. Ay, I do so.

     * Mistress Ford. Heaven make you better than your thoughts!

     * Ford. Amen! 1595

     * Mistress Page. You do yourself mighty wrong, Master Ford.

     * Ford. Ay, ay; I must bear it.

     * Sir Hugh Evans. If there be any pody in the house, and in the
       chambers, and in the coffers, and in the presses,
       heaven forgive my sins at the day of judgment! 1600

     * Doctor Caius. By gar, nor I too: there is no bodies.

     * Page. Fie, fie, Master Ford! are you not ashamed? What
       spirit, what devil suggests this imagination? I
       would not ha' your distemper in this kind for the
       wealth of Windsor Castle. 1605

     * Ford. 'Tis my fault, Master Page: I suffer for it.

     * Sir Hugh Evans. You suffer for a pad conscience: your wife is as
       honest a 'omans as I will desires among five
       thousand, and five hundred too.

     * Doctor Caius. By gar, I see 'tis an honest woman. 1610

     * Ford. Well, I promised you a dinner. Come, come, walk in
       the Park: I pray you, pardon me; I will hereafter
       make known to you why I have done this. Come,
       wife; come, Mistress Page. I pray you, pardon me;
       pray heartily, pardon me. 1615

     * Page. Let's go in, gentlemen; but, trust me, we'll mock
       him. I do invite you to-morrow morning to my house
       to breakfast: after, we'll a-birding together; I
       have a fine hawk for the bush. Shall it be so?

     * Ford. Any thing. 1620

     * Sir Hugh Evans. If there is one, I shall make two in the company.

     * Doctor Caius. If dere be one or two, I shall make-a the turd.

     * Ford. Pray you, go, Master Page.

     * Sir Hugh Evans. I pray you now, remembrance tomorrow on the lousy
       knave, mine host. 1625

     * Doctor Caius. Dat is good; by gar, with all my heart!

     * Sir Hugh Evans. A lousy knave, to have his gibes and his mockeries!

   Act III, Scene 4

   A room in PAGE’S house.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   [Enter FENTON and ANNE PAGE]
     * Fenton. I see I cannot get thy father's love; 1630
       Therefore no more turn me to him, sweet Nan.

     * Anne Page. Alas, how then?

     * Fenton. Why, thou must be thyself.
       He doth object I am too great of birth—,
       And that, my state being gall'd with my expense, 1635
       I seek to heal it only by his wealth:
       Besides these, other bars he lays before me,
       My riots past, my wild societies;
       And tells me 'tis a thing impossible
       I should love thee but as a property. 1640

     * Anne Page. May be he tells you true.

     * Fenton. No, heaven so speed me in my time to come!
       Albeit I will confess thy father's wealth
       Was the first motive that I woo'd thee, Anne:
       Yet, wooing thee, I found thee of more value 1645
       Than stamps in gold or sums in sealed bags;
       And 'tis the very riches of thyself
       That now I aim at.

     * Anne Page. Gentle Master Fenton,
       Yet seek my father's love; still seek it, sir: 1650
       If opportunity and humblest suit
       Cannot attain it, why, then,—hark you hither!

   [They converse apart]

   [Enter SHALLOW, SLENDER, and MISTRESS QUICKLY]
     * Robert Shallow. Break their talk, Mistress Quickly: my kinsman
       shall 1655
       speak for himself.

     * Slender. I'll make a shaft or a bolt on't: 'slid, 'tis but
       venturing.

     * Robert Shallow. Be not dismayed.

     * Slender. No, she shall not dismay me: I care not for that, 1660
       but that I am afeard.

     * Hostess Quickly. Hark ye; Master Slender would speak a word with
       you.

     * Anne Page. I come to him.
       [Aside]
       This is my father's choice. 1665
       O, what a world of vile ill-favor'd faults
       Looks handsome in three hundred pounds a-year!

     * Hostess Quickly. And how does good Master Fenton? Pray you, a word
       with you.

     * Robert Shallow. She's coming; to her, coz. O boy, thou hadst a
       father!

     * Slender. I had a father, Mistress Anne; my uncle can tell you 1670
       good jests of him. Pray you, uncle, tell Mistress
       Anne the jest, how my father stole two geese out of
       a pen, good uncle.

     * Robert Shallow. Mistress Anne, my cousin loves you.

     * Slender. Ay, that I do; as well as I love any woman in 1675
       Gloucestershire.

     * Robert Shallow. He will maintain you like a gentlewoman.

     * Slender. Ay, that I will, come cut and long-tail, under the
       degree of a squire.

     * Robert Shallow. He will make you a hundred and fifty pounds
       jointure. 1680

     * Anne Page. Good Master Shallow, let him woo for himself.

     * Robert Shallow. Marry, I thank you for it; I thank you for that
       good
       comfort. She calls you, coz: I'll leave you.

     * Anne Page. Now, Master Slender,—

     * Slender. Now, good Mistress Anne,— 1685

     * Anne Page. What is your will?

     * Slender. My will! 'od's heartlings, that's a pretty jest
       indeed! I ne'er made my will yet, I thank heaven; I
       am not such a sickly creature, I give heaven praise.

     * Anne Page. I mean, Master Slender, what would you with me? 1690

     * Slender. Truly, for mine own part, I would little or nothing
       with you. Your father and my uncle hath made
       motions: if it be my luck, so; if not, happy man be
       his dole! They can tell you how things go better
       than I can: you may ask your father; here he comes. 1695

   [Enter PAGE and MISTRESS PAGE]
     * Page. Now, Master Slender: love him, daughter Anne.
       Why, how now! what does Master Fenton here?
       You wrong me, sir, thus still to haunt my house:
       I told you, sir, my daughter is disposed of. 1700

     * Fenton. Nay, Master Page, be not impatient.

     * Mistress Page. Good Master Fenton, come not to my child.

     * Page. She is no match for you.

     * Fenton. Sir, will you hear me?

     * Page. No, good Master Fenton. 1705
       Come, Master Shallow; come, son Slender, in.
       Knowing my mind, you wrong me, Master Fenton.

   [Exeunt PAGE, SHALLOW, and SLENDER]
     * Hostess Quickly. Speak to Mistress Page.

     * Fenton. Good Mistress Page, for that I love your daughter 1710
       In such a righteous fashion as I do,
       Perforce, against all cheques, rebukes and manners,
       I must advance the colours of my love
       And not retire: let me have your good will.

     * Anne Page. Good mother, do not marry me to yond fool. 1715

     * Mistress Page. I mean it not; I seek you a better husband.

     * Hostess Quickly. That's my master, master doctor.

     * Anne Page. Alas, I had rather be set quick i' the earth
       And bowl'd to death with turnips!

     * Mistress Page. Come, trouble not yourself. Good Master Fenton, 1720
       I will not be your friend nor enemy:
       My daughter will I question how she loves you,
       And as I find her, so am I affected.
       Till then farewell, sir: she must needs go in;
       Her father will be angry. 1725

     * Fenton. Farewell, gentle mistress: farewell, Nan.

   [Exeunt MISTRESS PAGE and ANNE PAGE]
     * Hostess Quickly. This is my doing, now: 'Nay,' said I, 'will you
       cast
       away your child on a fool, and a physician? Look on
       Master Fenton:' this is my doing. 1730

     * Fenton. I thank thee; and I pray thee, once to-night
       Give my sweet Nan this ring: there's for thy pains.

     * Hostess Quickly. Now heaven send thee good fortune!
       [Exit FENTON]
       A kind heart he hath: a woman would run through 1735
       fire and water for such a kind heart. But yet I
       would my master had Mistress Anne; or I would
       Master Slender had her; or, in sooth, I would Master
       Fenton had her; I will do what I can for them all
       three; for so I have promised, and I'll be as good 1740
       as my word; but speciously for Master Fenton. Well,
       I must of another errand to Sir John Falstaff from
       my two mistresses: what a beast am I to slack it!

   [Exit]
   _______________________________________________________________________



   Act III, Scene 5

   A room in the Garter Inn.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   [Enter FALSTAFF and BARDOLPH]
     * Falstaff. Bardolph, I say,—

     * Bardolph. Here, sir.

     * Falstaff. Go fetch me a quart of sack; put a toast in't.
       [Exit BARDOLPH]
       Have I lived to be carried in a basket, like a 1750
       barrow of butcher's offal, and to be thrown in the
       Thames? Well, if I be served such another trick,
       I'll have my brains ta'en out and buttered, and give
       them to a dog for a new-year's gift. The rogues
       slighted me into the river with as little remorse as 1755
       they would have drowned a blind bitch's puppies,
       fifteen i' the litter: and you may know by my size
       that I have a kind of alacrity in sinking; if the
       bottom were as deep as hell, I should down. I had
       been drowned, but that the shore was shelvy and 1760
       shallow,—a death that I abhor; for the water swells
       a man; and what a thing should I have been when I
       had been swelled! I should have been a mountain of mummy.

   [Re-enter BARDOLPH with sack]
     * Bardolph. Here's Mistress Quickly, sir, to speak with you. 1765

     * Falstaff. Let me pour in some sack to the Thames water; for my
       belly's as cold as if I had swallowed snowballs for
       pills to cool the reins. Call her in.

     * Bardolph. Come in, woman!

   [Enter MISTRESS QUICKLY]
     * Hostess Quickly. By your leave; I cry you mercy: give your worship
       good morrow.

     * Falstaff. Take away these chalices. Go brew me a pottle of
       sack finely.

     * Bardolph. With eggs, sir? 1775

     * Falstaff. Simple of itself; I'll no pullet-sperm in my brewage.
       [Exit BARDOLPH]
       How now!

     * Hostess Quickly. Marry, sir, I come to your worship from Mistress
       Ford.

     * Falstaff. Mistress Ford! I have had ford enough; I was thrown 1780
       into the ford; I have my belly full of ford.

     * Hostess Quickly. Alas the day! good heart, that was not her fault:
       she does so take on with her men; they mistook their erection.

     * Falstaff. So did I mine, to build upon a foolish woman's promise.

     * Hostess Quickly. Well, she laments, sir, for it, that it would
       yearn 1785
       your heart to see it. Her husband goes this morning
       a-birding; she desires you once more to come to her
       between eight and nine: I must carry her word
       quickly: she'll make you amends, I warrant you.

     * Falstaff. Well, I will visit her: tell her so; and bid her 1790
       think what a man is: let her consider his frailty,
       and then judge of my merit.

     * Hostess Quickly. I will tell her.

     * Falstaff. Do so. Between nine and ten, sayest thou?

     * Hostess Quickly. Eight and nine, sir. 1795

     * Falstaff. Well, be gone: I will not miss her.

     * Hostess Quickly. Peace be with you, sir.

   [Exit]
     * Falstaff. I marvel I hear not of Master Brook; he sent me word
       to stay within: I like his money well. O, here he comes. 1800

   [Enter FORD]
     * Ford. Bless you, sir!

     * Falstaff. Now, master Brook, you come to know what hath passed
       between me and Ford's wife?

     * Ford. That, indeed, Sir John, is my business. 1805

     * Falstaff. Master Brook, I will not lie to you: I was at her
       house the hour she appointed me.

     * Ford. And sped you, sir?

     * Falstaff. Very ill-favoredly, Master Brook.

     * Ford. How so, sir? Did she change her determination? 1810

     * Falstaff. No, Master Brook; but the peaking Cornuto her
       husband, Master Brook, dwelling in a continual
       'larum of jealousy, comes me in the instant of our
       encounter, after we had embraced, kissed, protested,
       and, as it were, spoke the prologue of our comedy; 1815
       and at his heels a rabble of his companions, thither
       provoked and instigated by his distemper, and,
       forsooth, to search his house for his wife's love.

     * Ford. What, while you were there?

     * Falstaff. While I was there. 1820

     * Ford. And did he search for you, and could not find you?

     * Falstaff. You shall hear. As good luck would have it, comes
       in one Mistress Page; gives intelligence of Ford's
       approach; and, in her invention and Ford's wife's
       distraction, they conveyed me into a buck-basket. 1825

     * Ford. A buck-basket!

     * Falstaff. By the Lord, a buck-basket! rammed me in with foul
       shirts and smocks, socks, foul stockings, greasy
       napkins; that, Master Brook, there was the rankest
       compound of villanous smell that ever offended nostril. 1830

     * Ford. And how long lay you there?

     * Falstaff. Nay, you shall hear, Master Brook, what I have
       suffered to bring this woman to evil for your good.
       Being thus crammed in the basket, a couple of Ford's
       knaves, his hinds, were called forth by their 1835
       mistress to carry me in the name of foul clothes to
       Datchet-lane: they took me on their shoulders; met
       the jealous knave their master in the door, who
       asked them once or twice what they had in their
       basket: I quaked for fear, lest the lunatic knave 1840
       would have searched it; but fate, ordaining he
       should be a cuckold, held his hand. Well: on went he
       for a search, and away went I for foul clothes. But
       mark the sequel, Master Brook: I suffered the pangs
       of three several deaths; first, an intolerable 1845
       fright, to be detected with a jealous rotten
       bell-wether; next, to be compassed, like a good
       bilbo, in the circumference of a peck, hilt to
       point, heel to head; and then, to be stopped in,
       like a strong distillation, with stinking clothes 1850
       that fretted in their own grease: think of that,—a
       man of my kidney,—think of that,—that am as subject
       to heat as butter; a man of continual dissolution
       and thaw: it was a miracle to scape suffocation.
       And in the height of this bath, when I was more than 1855
       half stewed in grease, like a Dutch dish, to be
       thrown into the Thames, and cooled, glowing hot,
       in that surge, like a horse-shoe; think of
       that,—hissing hot,—think of that, Master Brook.

     * Ford. In good sadness, I am sorry that for my sake you 1860
       have sufferd all this. My suit then is desperate;
       you'll undertake her no more?

     * Falstaff. Master Brook, I will be thrown into Etna, as I have
       been into Thames, ere I will leave her thus. Her
       husband is this morning gone a-birding: I have 1865
       received from her another embassy of meeting; 'twixt
       eight and nine is the hour, Master Brook.

     * Ford. 'Tis past eight already, sir.

     * Falstaff. Is it? I will then address me to my appointment.
       Come to me at your convenient leisure, and you shall 1870
       know how I speed; and the conclusion shall be
       crowned with your enjoying her. Adieu. You shall
       have her, Master Brook; Master Brook, you shall
       cuckold Ford.

   [Exit]
     * Ford. Hum! ha! is this a vision? is this a dream? do I
       sleep? Master Ford awake! awake, Master Ford!
       there's a hole made in your best coat, Master Ford.
       This 'tis to be married! this 'tis to have linen
       and buck-baskets! Well, I will proclaim myself 1880
       what I am: I will now take the lecher; he is at my
       house; he cannot 'scape me; 'tis impossible he
       should; he cannot creep into a halfpenny purse,
       nor into a pepper-box: but, lest the devil that
       guides him should aid him, I will search 1885
       impossible places. Though what I am I cannot avoid,
       yet to be what I would not shall not make me tame:
       if I have horns to make one mad, let the proverb go
       with me: I'll be horn-mad.

   [Exit]

   Act IV, Scene 1

   A street.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   [Enter MISTRESS PAGE, MISTRESS QUICKLY, and WILLIAM PAGE]
     * Mistress Page. Is he at Master Ford's already, think'st thou?

     * Hostess Quickly. Sure he is by this, or will be presently: but,
       truly, he is very courageous mad about his throwing
       into the water. Mistress Ford desires you to come suddenly. 1895

     * Mistress Page. I'll be with her by and by; I'll but bring my young
       man here to school. Look, where his master comes;
       'tis a playing-day, I see.
       [Enter SIR HUGH EVANS]
       How now, Sir Hugh! no school to-day? 1900

     * Sir Hugh Evans. No; Master Slender is let the boys leave to play.

     * Hostess Quickly. Blessing of his heart!

     * Mistress Page. Sir Hugh, my husband says my son profits nothing in
       the world at his book. I pray you, ask him some
       questions in his accidence. 1905

     * Sir Hugh Evans. Come hither, William; hold up your head; come.

     * Mistress Page. Come on, sirrah; hold up your head; answer your
       master, be not afraid.

     * Sir Hugh Evans. William, how many numbers is in nouns?

     * William Page. Two. 1910

     * Hostess Quickly. Truly, I thought there had been one number more,
       because they say, 'Od's nouns.'

     * Sir Hugh Evans. Peace your tattlings! What is 'fair,' William?

     * William Page. Pulcher.

     * Hostess Quickly. Polecats! there are fairer things than polecats,
       sure. 1915

     * Sir Hugh Evans. You are a very simplicity 'oman: I pray you peace.
       What is 'lapis,' William?

     * William Page. A stone.

     * Sir Hugh Evans. And what is 'a stone,' William?

     * William Page. A pebble. 1920

     * Sir Hugh Evans. No, it is 'lapis:' I pray you, remember in your
       prain.

     * William Page. Lapis.

     * Sir Hugh Evans. That is a good William. What is he, William, that
       does lend articles?

     * William Page. Articles are borrowed of the pronoun, and be thus
       1925
       declined, Singulariter, nominativo, hic, haec, hoc.

     * Sir Hugh Evans. Nominativo, hig, hag, hog; pray you, mark:
       genitivo, hujus. Well, what is your accusative case?

     * William Page. Accusativo, hinc.

     * Sir Hugh Evans. I pray you, have your remembrance, child, 1930
       accusative, hung, hang, hog.

     * Hostess Quickly. 'Hang-hog' is Latin for bacon, I warrant you.

     * Sir Hugh Evans. Leave your prabbles, 'oman. What is the focative
       case, William?

     * William Page. O,—vocativo, O. 1935

     * Sir Hugh Evans. Remember, William; focative is caret.

     * Hostess Quickly. And that's a good root.

     * Sir Hugh Evans. 'Oman, forbear.

     * Mistress Page. Peace!

     * Sir Hugh Evans. What is your genitive case plural, William? 1940

     * William Page. Genitive case!

     * Sir Hugh Evans. Ay.

     * William Page. Genitive,—horum, harum, horum.

     * Hostess Quickly. Vengeance of Jenny's case! fie on her! never name
       her, child, if she be a whore. 1945

     * Sir Hugh Evans. For shame, 'oman.

     * Hostess Quickly. You do ill to teach the child such words: he
       teaches him to hick and to hack, which they'll do
       fast enough of themselves, and to call 'horum:' fie upon you!

     * Sir Hugh Evans. 'Oman, art thou lunatics? hast thou no 1950
       understandings for thy cases and the numbers of the
       genders? Thou art as foolish Christian creatures as
       I would desires.

     * Mistress Page. Prithee, hold thy peace.

     * Sir Hugh Evans. Show me now, William, some declensions of your
       pronouns. 1955

     * William Page. Forsooth, I have forgot.

     * Sir Hugh Evans. It is qui, quae, quod: if you forget your 'quies,'
       your 'quaes,' and your 'quods,' you must be
       preeches. Go your ways, and play; go.

     * Mistress Page. He is a better scholar than I thought he was. 1960

     * Sir Hugh Evans. He is a good sprag memory. Farewell, Mistress Page.

     * Mistress Page. Adieu, good Sir Hugh.
       [Exit SIR HUGH EVANS]
       Get you home, boy. Come, we stay too long.

   Act IV, Scene 2

   A room in FORD’S house.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   [Enter FALSTAFF and MISTRESS FORD]
     * Falstaff. Mistress Ford, your sorrow hath eaten up my
       sufferance. I see you are obsequious in your love,
       and I profess requital to a hair's breadth; not
       only, Mistress Ford, in the simple 1970
       office of love, but in all the accoutrement,
       complement and ceremony of it. But are you
       sure of your husband now?

     * Mistress Ford. He's a-birding, sweet Sir John.

     * Mistress Page. [Within] What, ho, gossip Ford! what, ho! 1975

     * Mistress Ford. Step into the chamber, Sir John.

   [Exit FALSTAFF]

   [Enter MISTRESS PAGE]
     * Mistress Page. How now, sweetheart! who's at home besides yourself?

     * Mistress Ford. Why, none but mine own people. 1980

     * Mistress Page. Indeed!

     * Mistress Ford. No, certainly.
       [Aside to her]
       Speak louder.

     * Mistress Page. Truly, I am so glad you have nobody here. 1985

     * Mistress Ford. Why?

     * Mistress Page. Why, woman, your husband is in his old lunes again:
       he so takes on yonder with my husband; so rails
       against all married mankind; so curses all Eve's
       daughters, of what complexion soever; and so buffets 1990
       himself on the forehead, crying, 'Peer out, peer
       out!' that any madness I ever yet beheld seemed but
       tameness, civility and patience, to this his
       distemper he is in now: I am glad the fat knight is not here.

     * Mistress Ford. Why, does he talk of him? 1995

     * Mistress Page. Of none but him; and swears he was carried out, the
       last time he searched for him, in a basket; protests
       to my husband he is now here, and hath drawn him and
       the rest of their company from their sport, to make
       another experiment of his suspicion: but I am glad 2000
       the knight is not here; now he shall see his own foolery.

     * Mistress Ford. How near is he, Mistress Page?

     * Mistress Page. Hard by; at street end; he will be here anon.

     * Mistress Ford. I am undone! The knight is here.

     * Mistress Page. Why then you are utterly shamed, and he's but a dead
       2005
       man. What a woman are you!—Away with him, away
       with him! better shame than murder.

     * Ford. Which way should be go? how should I bestow him?
       Shall I put him into the basket again?

   [Re-enter FALSTAFF]
     * Falstaff. No, I'll come no more i' the basket. May I not go
       out ere he come?

     * Mistress Page. Alas, three of Master Ford's brothers watch the door
       with pistols, that none shall issue out; otherwise
       you might slip away ere he came. But what make you here? 2015

     * Falstaff. What shall I do? I'll creep up into the chimney.

     * Mistress Ford. There they always use to discharge their
       birding-pieces. Creep into the kiln-hole.

     * Falstaff. Where is it?

     * Mistress Ford. He will seek there, on my word. Neither press, 2020
       coffer, chest, trunk, well, vault, but he hath an
       abstract for the remembrance of such places, and
       goes to them by his note: there is no hiding you in the house.

     * Falstaff. I'll go out then.

     * Mistress Page. If you go out in your own semblance, you die, Sir
       2025
       John. Unless you go out disguised—

     * Mistress Ford. How might we disguise him?

     * Mistress Page. Alas the day, I know not! There is no woman's gown
       big enough for him otherwise he might put on a hat,
       a muffler and a kerchief, and so escape. 2030

     * Falstaff. Good hearts, devise something: any extremity rather
       than a mischief.

     * Mistress Ford. My maid's aunt, the fat woman of Brentford, has a
       gown above.

     * Mistress Page. On my word, it will serve him; she's as big as he
       2035
       is: and there's her thrummed hat and her muffler
       too. Run up, Sir John.

     * Mistress Ford. Go, go, sweet Sir John: Mistress Page and I will
       look some linen for your head.

     * Mistress Page. Quick, quick! we'll come dress you straight: put
       2040
       on the gown the while.

   [Exit FALSTAFF]
     * Mistress Ford. I would my husband would meet him in this shape: he
       cannot abide the old woman of Brentford; he swears
       she's a witch; forbade her my house and hath 2045
       threatened to beat her.

     * Mistress Page. Heaven guide him to thy husband's cudgel, and the
       devil guide his cudgel afterwards!

     * Mistress Ford. But is my husband coming?

     * Mistress Page. Ah, in good sadness, is he; and talks of the basket
       2050
       too, howsoever he hath had intelligence.

     * Mistress Ford. We'll try that; for I'll appoint my men to carry the
       basket again, to meet him at the door with it, as
       they did last time.

     * Mistress Page. Nay, but he'll be here presently: let's go dress him
       2055
       like the witch of Brentford.

     * Mistress Ford. I'll first direct my men what they shall do with the
       basket. Go up; I'll bring linen for him straight.

   [Exit]
     * Mistress Page. Hang him, dishonest varlet! we cannot misuse him
       enough. 2060
       We'll leave a proof, by that which we will do,
       Wives may be merry, and yet honest too:
       We do not act that often jest and laugh;
       'Tis old, but true, Still swine eat all the draff.

   [Exit]

   [Re-enter MISTRESS FORD with two Servants]
     * Mistress Ford. Go, sirs, take the basket again on your shoulders:
       your master is hard at door; if he bid you set it
       down, obey him: quickly, dispatch.

   [Exit]
     * First Servant. Come, come, take it up.

     * Second Servant. Pray heaven it be not full of knight again.

     * First Servant. I hope not; I had as lief bear so much lead.

   [Enter FORD, PAGE, SHALLOW, DOCTOR CAIUS, and SIR HUGH EVANS]
     * Ford. Ay, but if it prove true, Master Page, have you any 2075
       way then to unfool me again? Set down the basket,
       villain! Somebody call my wife. Youth in a basket!
       O you panderly rascals! there's a knot, a ging, a
       pack, a conspiracy against me: now shall the devil
       be shamed. What, wife, I say! Come, come forth! 2080
       Behold what honest clothes you send forth to bleaching!

     * Page. Why, this passes, Master Ford; you are not to go
       loose any longer; you must be pinioned.

     * Sir Hugh Evans. Why, this is lunatics! this is mad as a mad dog!

     * Robert Shallow. Indeed, Master Ford, this is not well, indeed. 2085

     * Ford. So say I too, sir.
       [Re-enter MISTRESS FORD]
       Come hither, Mistress Ford; Mistress Ford the honest
       woman, the modest wife, the virtuous creature, that
       hath the jealous fool to her husband! I suspect 2090
       without cause, mistress, do I?

     * Mistress Ford. Heaven be my witness you do, if you suspect me in
       any dishonesty.

     * Ford. Well said, brazen-face! hold it out. Come forth, sirrah!

   [Pulling clothes out of the basket]
     * Page. This passes!

     * Mistress Ford. Are you not ashamed? let the clothes alone.

     * Ford. I shall find you anon.

     * Sir Hugh Evans. 'Tis unreasonable! Will you take up your wife's
       clothes? Come away. 2100

     * Ford. Empty the basket, I say!

     * Mistress Ford. Why, man, why?

     * Ford. Master Page, as I am a man, there was one conveyed
       out of my house yesterday in this basket: why may
       not he be there again? In my house I am sure he is: 2105
       my intelligence is true; my jealousy is reasonable.
       Pluck me out all the linen.

     * Mistress Ford. If you find a man there, he shall die a flea's
       death.

     * Page. Here's no man.

     * Robert Shallow. By my fidelity, this is not well, Master Ford; this
       2110
       wrongs you.

     * Sir Hugh Evans. Master Ford, you must pray, and not follow the
       imaginations of your own heart: this is jealousies.

     * Ford. Well, he's not here I seek for.

     * Page. No, nor nowhere else but in your brain. 2115

     * Ford. Help to search my house this one time. If I find
       not what I seek, show no colour for my extremity; let
       me for ever be your table-sport; let them say of
       me, 'As jealous as Ford, Chat searched a hollow
       walnut for his wife's leman.' Satisfy me once more; 2120
       once more search with me.

     * Mistress Ford. What, ho, Mistress Page! come you and the old woman
       down; my husband will come into the chamber.

     * Ford. Old woman! what old woman's that?

     * Mistress Ford. Nay, it is my maid's aunt of Brentford. 2125

     * Ford. A witch, a quean, an old cozening quean! Have I not
       forbid her my house? She comes of errands, does
       she? We are simple men; we do not know what's
       brought to pass under the profession of
       fortune-telling. She works by charms, by spells, 2130
       by the figure, and such daubery as this is, beyond
       our element we know nothing. Come down, you witch,
       you hag, you; come down, I say!

     * Mistress Ford. Nay, good, sweet husband! Good gentlemen, let him
       not strike the old woman. 2135

   [Re-enter FALSTAFF in woman's clothes, and MISTRESS PAGE]
     * Mistress Page. Come, Mother Prat; come, give me your hand.

     * Ford. I'll prat her.
       [Beating him]
       Out of my door, you witch, you hag, you baggage, you 2140
       polecat, you runyon! out, out! I'll conjure you,
       I'll fortune-tell you.

   [Exit FALSTAFF]
     * Mistress Page. Are you not ashamed? I think you have killed the
       poor woman. 2145

     * Mistress Ford. Nay, he will do it. 'Tis a goodly credit for you.

     * Ford. Hang her, witch!

     * Sir Hugh Evans. By the yea and no, I think the 'oman is a witch
       indeed: I like not when a 'oman has a great peard;
       I spy a great peard under his muffler. 2150

     * Ford. Will you follow, gentlemen? I beseech you, follow;
       see but the issue of my jealousy: if I cry out thus
       upon no trail, never trust me when I open again.

     * Page. Let's obey his humour a little further: come,
       gentlemen. 2155

   [Exeunt FORD, PAGE, SHALLOW, DOCTOR CAIUS, and SIR HUGH EVANS]
     * Mistress Page. Trust me, he beat him most pitifully.

     * Mistress Ford. Nay, by the mass, that he did not; he beat him most
       unpitifully, methought.

     * Mistress Page. I'll have the cudgel hallowed and hung o'er the 2160
       altar; it hath done meritorious service.

     * Mistress Ford. What think you? may we, with the warrant of
       womanhood and the witness of a good conscience,
       pursue him with any further revenge?

     * Mistress Page. The spirit of wantonness is, sure, scared out of
       2165
       him: if the devil have him not in fee-simple, with
       fine and recovery, he will never, I think, in the
       way of waste, attempt us again.

     * Mistress Ford. Shall we tell our husbands how we have served him?

     * Mistress Page. Yes, by all means; if it be but to scrape the 2170
       figures out of your husband's brains. If they can
       find in their hearts the poor unvirtuous fat knight
       shall be any further afflicted, we two will still be
       the ministers.

     * Mistress Ford. I'll warrant they'll have him publicly shamed: and
       2175
       methinks there would be no period to the jest,
       should he not be publicly shamed.

     * Mistress Page. Come, to the forge with it then; shape it: I would
       not have things cool.

   [Exeunt]

   [Enter Host and BARDOLPH]
     * Bardolph. Sir, the Germans desire to have three of your
       horses: the duke himself will be to-morrow at
       court, and they are going to meet him.

     * Host. What duke should that be comes so secretly? I hear 2185
       not of him in the court. Let me speak with the
       gentlemen: they speak English?

     * Bardolph. Ay, sir; I'll call them to you.

     * Host. They shall have my horses; but I'll make them pay;
       I'll sauce them: they have had my house a week at 2190
       command; I have turned away my other guests: they
       must come off; I'll sauce them. Come.

   [Exeunt]

   Act IV, Scene 4

   A room in FORD’S house.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   [Enter PAGE, FORD, MISTRESS PAGE, MISTRESS FORD,] [p]and SIR HUGH
   EVANS]
     * Sir Hugh Evans. 'Tis one of the best discretions of a 'oman as ever
       I did look upon.

     * Page. And did he send you both these letters at an instant?

     * Mistress Page. Within a quarter of an hour.

     * Ford. Pardon me, wife. Henceforth do what thou wilt; 2200
       I rather will suspect the sun with cold
       Than thee with wantonness: now doth thy honour stand
       In him that was of late an heretic,
       As firm as faith.

     * Page. 'Tis well, 'tis well; no more: 2205
       Be not as extreme in submission
       As in offence.
       But let our plot go forward: let our wives
       Yet once again, to make us public sport,
       Appoint a meeting with this old fat fellow, 2210
       Where we may take him and disgrace him for it.

     * Ford. There is no better way than that they spoke of.

     * Page. How? to send him word they'll meet him in the park
       at midnight? Fie, fie! he'll never come.

     * Sir Hugh Evans. You say he has been thrown in the rivers and has
       2215
       been grievously peaten as an old 'oman: methinks
       there should be terrors in him that he should not
       come; methinks his flesh is punished, he shall have
       no desires.

     * Page. So think I too. 2220

     * Mistress Ford. Devise but how you'll use him when he comes,
       And let us two devise to bring him thither.

     * Mistress Page. There is an old tale goes that Herne the hunter,
       Sometime a keeper here in Windsor forest,
       Doth all the winter-time, at still midnight, 2225
       Walk round about an oak, with great ragg'd horns;
       And there he blasts the tree and takes the cattle
       And makes milch-kine yield blood and shakes a chain
       In a most hideous and dreadful manner:
       You have heard of such a spirit, and well you know 2230
       The superstitious idle-headed eld
       Received and did deliver to our age
       This tale of Herne the hunter for a truth.

     * Page. Why, yet there want not many that do fear
       In deep of night to walk by this Herne's oak: 2235
       But what of this?

     * Mistress Ford. Marry, this is our device;
       That Falstaff at that oak shall meet with us.

     * Page. Well, let it not be doubted but he'll come:
       And in this shape when you have brought him thither, 2240
       What shall be done with him? what is your plot?

     * Mistress Page. That likewise have we thought upon, and thus:
       Nan Page my daughter and my little son
       And three or four more of their growth we'll dress
       Like urchins, ouphes and fairies, green and white, 2245
       With rounds of waxen tapers on their heads,
       And rattles in their hands: upon a sudden,
       As Falstaff, she and I, are newly met,
       Let them from forth a sawpit rush at once
       With some diffused song: upon their sight, 2250
       We two in great amazedness will fly:
       Then let them all encircle him about
       And, fairy-like, to-pinch the unclean knight,
       And ask him why, that hour of fairy revel,
       In their so sacred paths he dares to tread 2255
       In shape profane.

     * Mistress Ford. And till he tell the truth,
       Let the supposed fairies pinch him sound
       And burn him with their tapers.

     * Mistress Page. The truth being known, 2260
       We'll all present ourselves, dis-horn the spirit,
       And mock him home to Windsor.

     * Ford. The children must
       Be practised well to this, or they'll ne'er do't.

     * Sir Hugh Evans. I will teach the children their behaviors; and I
       2265
       will be like a jack-an-apes also, to burn the
       knight with my taber.

     * Ford. That will be excellent. I'll go and buy them vizards.

     * Mistress Page. My Nan shall be the queen of all the fairies,
       Finely attired in a robe of white. 2270

     * Page. That silk will I go buy.
       [Aside]
       And in that time
       Shall Master Slender steal my Nan away
       And marry her at Eton. Go send to Falstaff straight. 2275

     * Ford. Nay I'll to him again in name of Brook
       He'll tell me all his purpose: sure, he'll come.

     * Mistress Page. Fear not you that. Go get us properties
       And tricking for our fairies.

     * Sir Hugh Evans. Let us about it: it is admirable pleasures and fery
       2280
       honest knaveries.

   [Exeunt PAGE, FORD, and SIR HUGH EVANS]
     * Mistress Page. Go, Mistress Ford,
       Send quickly to Sir John, to know his mind.
       [Exit MISTRESS FORD] 2285
       I'll to the doctor: he hath my good will,
       And none but he, to marry with Nan Page.
       That Slender, though well landed, is an idiot;
       And he my husband best of all affects.
       The doctor is well money'd, and his friends 2290
       Potent at court: he, none but he, shall have her,
       Though twenty thousand worthier come to crave her.

   [Exit]

   Act IV, Scene 5

   A room in the Garter Inn.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   [Enter Host and SIMPLE]
     * Host. What wouldst thou have, boor? what: thick-skin? 2295
       speak, breathe, discuss; brief, short, quick, snap.

     * Simple. Marry, sir, I come to speak with Sir John Falstaff
       from Master Slender.

     * Host. There's his chamber, his house, his castle, his
       standing-bed and truckle-bed; 'tis painted about 2300
       with the story of the Prodigal, fresh and new. Go
       knock and call; hell speak like an Anthropophaginian
       unto thee: knock, I say.

     * Simple. There's an old woman, a fat woman, gone up into his
       chamber: I'll be so bold as stay, sir, till she come 2305
       down; I come to speak with her, indeed.

     * Host. Ha! a fat woman! the knight may be robbed: I'll
       call. Bully knight! bully Sir John! speak from
       thy lungs military: art thou there? it is thine
       host, thine Ephesian, calls. 2310

     * Falstaff. [Above] How now, mine host!

     * Host. Here's a Bohemian-Tartar tarries the coming down of
       thy fat woman. Let her descend, bully, let her
       descend; my chambers are honourable: fie! privacy?
       fie! 2315

   [Enter FALSTAFF]
     * Falstaff. There was, mine host, an old fat woman even now with
       me; but she's gone.

     * Simple. Pray you, sir, was't not the wise woman of
       Brentford? 2320

     * Falstaff. Ay, marry, was it, mussel-shell: what would you with her?

     * Simple. My master, sir, Master Slender, sent to her, seeing
       her go through the streets, to know, sir, whether
       one Nym, sir, that beguiled him of a chain, had the
       chain or no. 2325

     * Falstaff. I spake with the old woman about it.

     * Simple. And what says she, I pray, sir?

     * Falstaff. Marry, she says that the very same man that
       beguiled Master Slender of his chain cozened him of
       it. 2330

     * Simple. I would I could have spoken with the woman herself;
       I had other things to have spoken with her too from
       him.

     * Falstaff. What are they? let us know.

     * Host. Ay, come; quick. 2335

     * Simple. I may not conceal them, sir.

     * Host. Conceal them, or thou diest.

     * Simple. Why, sir, they were nothing but about Mistress Anne
       Page; to know if it were my master's fortune to
       have her or no. 2340

     * Falstaff. 'Tis, 'tis his fortune.

     * Simple. What, sir?

     * Falstaff. To have her, or no. Go; say the woman told me so.

     * Simple. May I be bold to say so, sir?

     * Falstaff. Ay, sir; like who more bold. 2345

     * Simple. I thank your worship: I shall make my master glad
       with these tidings.

   [Exit]
     * Host. Thou art clerkly, thou art clerkly, Sir John. Was
       there a wise woman with thee? 2350

     * Falstaff. Ay, that there was, mine host; one that hath taught
       me more wit than ever I learned before in my life;
       and I paid nothing for it neither, but was paid for
       my learning.

   [Enter BARDOLPH]
     * Bardolph. Out, alas, sir! cozenage, mere cozenage!

     * Host. Where be my horses? speak well of them, varletto.

     * Bardolph. Run away with the cozeners; for so soon as I came
       beyond Eton, they threw me off from behind one of
       them, in a slough of mire; and set spurs and away, 2360
       like three German devils, three Doctor Faustuses.

     * Host. They are gone but to meet the duke, villain: do not
       say they be fled; Germans are honest men.

   [Enter SIR HUGH EVANS]
     * Sir Hugh Evans. Where is mine host? 2365

     * Host. What is the matter, sir?

     * Sir Hugh Evans. Have a care of your entertainments: there is a
       friend of mine come to town tells me there is three
       cozen-germans that has cozened all the hosts of
       Readins, of Maidenhead, of Colebrook, of horses and 2370
       money. I tell you for good will, look you: you
       are wise and full of gibes and vlouting-stocks, and
       'tis not convenient you should be cozened. Fare you well.

   [Exit]

   [Enter DOCTOR CAIUS]
     * Doctor Caius. Vere is mine host de Jarteer?

     * Host. Here, master doctor, in perplexity and doubtful dilemma.

     * Doctor Caius. I cannot tell vat is dat: but it is tell-a me dat
       you make grand preparation for a duke de Jamany: by
       my trot, dere is no duke dat the court is know to 2380
       come. I tell you for good vill: adieu.

   [Exit]
     * Host. Hue and cry, villain, go! Assist me, knight. I am
       undone! Fly, run, hue and cry, villain! I am undone!

   [Exeunt Host and BARDOLPH]
     * Falstaff. I would all the world might be cozened; for I have
       been cozened and beaten too. If it should come to
       the ear of the court, how I have been transformed
       and how my transformation hath been washed and
       cudgelled, they would melt me out of my fat drop by 2390
       drop and liquor fishermen's boots with me; I warrant
       they would whip me with their fine wits till I were
       as crest-fallen as a dried pear. I never prospered
       since I forswore myself at primero. Well, if my
       wind were but long enough to say my prayers, I would repent. 2395
       [Enter MISTRESS QUICKLY]
       Now, whence come you?

     * Hostess Quickly. From the two parties, forsooth.

     * Falstaff. The devil take one party and his dam the other! and
       so they shall be both bestowed. I have suffered more 2400
       for their sakes, more than the villanous inconstancy
       of man's disposition is able to bear.

     * Hostess Quickly. And have not they suffered? Yes, I warrant;
       speciously one of them; Mistress Ford, good heart,
       is beaten black and blue, that you cannot see a 2405
       white spot about her.

     * Falstaff. What tellest thou me of black and blue? I was
       beaten myself into all the colours of the rainbow;
       and I was like to be apprehended for the witch of
       Brentford: but that my admirable dexterity of wit, 2410
       my counterfeiting the action of an old woman,
       delivered me, the knave constable had set me i' the
       stocks, i' the common stocks, for a witch.

     * Hostess Quickly. Sir, let me speak with you in your chamber: you
       shall hear how things go; and, I warrant, to your 2415
       content. Here is a letter will say somewhat. Good
       hearts, what ado here is to bring you together!
       Sure, one of you does not serve heaven well, that
       you are so crossed.

     * Falstaff. Come up into my chamber. 2420

   [Exeunt]

   [Enter FENTON and Host]
     * Host. Master Fenton, talk not to me; my mind is heavy: I
       will give over all.

     * Fenton. Yet hear me speak. Assist me in my purpose, 2425
       And, as I am a gentleman, I'll give thee
       A hundred pound in gold more than your loss.

     * Host. I will hear you, Master Fenton; and I will at the
       least keep your counsel.

     * Fenton. From time to time I have acquainted you 2430
       With the dear love I bear to fair Anne Page;
       Who mutually hath answer'd my affection,
       So far forth as herself might be her chooser,
       Even to my wish: I have a letter from her
       Of such contents as you will wonder at; 2435
       The mirth whereof so larded with my matter,
       That neither singly can be manifested,
       Without the show of both; fat Falstaff
       Hath a great scene: the image of the jest
       I'll show you here at large. Hark, good mine host. 2440
       To-night at Herne's oak, just 'twixt twelve and one,
       Must my sweet Nan present the Fairy Queen;
       The purpose why, is here: in which disguise,
       While other jests are something rank on foot,
       Her father hath commanded her to slip 2445
       Away with Slender and with him at Eton
       Immediately to marry: she hath consented: Now, sir,
       Her mother, ever strong against that match
       And firm for Doctor Caius, hath appointed
       That he shall likewise shuffle her away, 2450
       While other sports are tasking of their minds,
       And at the deanery, where a priest attends,
       Straight marry her: to this her mother's plot
       She seemingly obedient likewise hath
       Made promise to the doctor. Now, thus it rests: 2455
       Her father means she shall be all in white,
       And in that habit, when Slender sees his time
       To take her by the hand and bid her go,
       She shall go with him: her mother hath intended,
       The better to denote her to the doctor, 2460
       For they must all be mask'd and vizarded,
       That quaint in green she shall be loose enrobed,
       With ribands pendent, flaring 'bout her head;
       And when the doctor spies his vantage ripe,
       To pinch her by the hand, and, on that token, 2465
       The maid hath given consent to go with him.

     * Host. Which means she to deceive, father or mother?

     * Fenton. Both, my good host, to go along with me:
       And here it rests, that you'll procure the vicar
       To stay for me at church 'twixt twelve and one, 2470
       And, in the lawful name of marrying,
       To give our hearts united ceremony.

     * Host. Well, husband your device; I'll to the vicar:
       Bring you the maid, you shall not lack a priest.

     * Fenton. So shall I evermore be bound to thee; 2475
       Besides, I'll make a present recompense.

   [Exeunt]

   A room in the Garter Inn.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   [Enter FALSTAFF and MISTRESS QUICKLY]
     * Falstaff. Prithee, no more prattling; go. I'll hold. This is
       the third time; I hope good luck lies in odd 2480
       numbers. Away I go. They say there is divinity in
       odd numbers, either in nativity, chance, or death. Away!

     * Hostess Quickly. I'll provide you a chain; and I'll do what I can
       to
       get you a pair of horns.

     * Falstaff. Away, I say; time wears: hold up your head, and mince.
       2485
       [Exit MISTRESS QUICKLY]
       [Enter FORD]
       How now, Master Brook! Master Brook, the matter
       will be known to-night, or never. Be you in the
       Park about midnight, at Herne's oak, and you shall 2490
       see wonders.

     * Ford. Went you not to her yesterday, sir, as you told me
       you had appointed?

     * Falstaff. I went to her, Master Brook, as you see, like a poor
       old man: but I came from her, Master Brook, like a 2495
       poor old woman. That same knave Ford, her husband,
       hath the finest mad devil of jealousy in him,
       Master Brook, that ever governed frenzy. I will tell
       you: he beat me grievously, in the shape of a
       woman; for in the shape of man, Master Brook, I fear 2500
       not Goliath with a weaver's beam; because I know
       also life is a shuttle. I am in haste; go along
       with me: I'll tell you all, Master Brook. Since I
       plucked geese, played truant and whipped top, I knew
       not what 'twas to be beaten till lately. Follow 2505
       me: I'll tell you strange things of this knave
       Ford, on whom to-night I will be revenged, and I
       will deliver his wife into your hand. Follow.
       Strange things in hand, Master Brook! Follow.

   [Enter PAGE, SHALLOW, and SLENDER]
     * Page. Come, come; we'll couch i' the castle-ditch till we
       see the light of our fairies. Remember, son Slender,
       my daughter.

     * Slender. Ay, forsooth; I have spoke with her and we have a 2515
       nay-word how to know one another: I come to her in
       white, and cry 'mum;' she cries 'budget;' and by
       that we know one another.

     * Robert Shallow. That's good too: but what needs either your 'mum'
       or her 'budget?' the white will decipher her well 2520
       enough. It hath struck ten o'clock.

     * Page. The night is dark; light and spirits will become it
       well. Heaven prosper our sport! No man means evil
       but the devil, and we shall know him by his horns.
       Let's away; follow me. 2525

   Act V, Scene 3

   A street leading to the Park.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   [Enter MISTRESS PAGE, MISTRESS FORD, and DOCTOR CAIUS]
     * Mistress Page. Master doctor, my daughter is in green: when you
       see your time, take her by the band, away with her
       to the deanery, and dispatch it quickly. Go before 2530
       into the Park: we two must go together.

     * Doctor Caius. I know vat I have to do. Adieu.

     * Mistress Page. Fare you well, sir.
       [Exit DOCTOR CAIUS]
       My husband will not rejoice so much at the abuse of 2535
       Falstaff as he will chafe at the doctor's marrying
       my daughter: but 'tis no matter; better a little
       chiding than a great deal of heart-break.

     * Mistress Ford. Where is Nan now and her troop of fairies, and the
       Welsh devil Hugh? 2540

     * Mistress Page. They are all couched in a pit hard by Herne's oak,
       with obscured lights; which, at the very instant of
       Falstaff's and our meeting, they will at once
       display to the night.

     * Mistress Ford. That cannot choose but amaze him. 2545

     * Mistress Page. If he be not amazed, he will be mocked; if he be
       amazed, he will every way be mocked.

     * Mistress Ford. We'll betray him finely.

     * Mistress Page. Against such lewdsters and their lechery
       Those that betray them do no treachery. 2550

     * Mistress Ford. The hour draws on. To the oak, to the oak!

       be pold, I pray you; follow me into the pit; and 2555
       when I give the watch-'ords, do as I pid you:

   Another part of the Park.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   [Enter FALSTAFF disguised as Herne]
     * Falstaff. The Windsor bell hath struck twelve; the minute 2560
       draws on. Now, the hot-blooded gods assist me!
       Remember, Jove, thou wast a bull for thy Europa; love
       set on thy horns. O powerful love! that, in some
       respects, makes a beast a man, in some other, a man
       a beast. You were also, Jupiter, a swan for the love 2565
       of Leda. O omnipotent Love! how near the god drew
       to the complexion of a goose! A fault done first in
       the form of a beast. O Jove, a beastly fault! And
       then another fault in the semblance of a fowl; think
       on 't, Jove; a foul fault! When gods have hot 2570
       backs, what shall poor men do? For me, I am here a
       Windsor stag; and the fattest, I think, i' the
       forest. Send me a cool rut-time, Jove, or who can
       blame me to piss my tallow? Who comes here? my
       doe? 2575

   [Enter MISTRESS FORD and MISTRESS PAGE]
     * Mistress Ford. Sir John! art thou there, my deer? my male deer?

     * Falstaff. My doe with the black scut! Let the sky rain
       potatoes; let it thunder to the tune of Green
       Sleeves, hail kissing-comfits and snow eringoes; let 2580
       there come a tempest of provocation, I will shelter me here.

     * Mistress Ford. Mistress Page is come with me, sweetheart.

     * Falstaff. Divide me like a bribe buck, each a haunch: I will
       keep my sides to myself, my shoulders for the fellow
       of this walk, and my horns I bequeath your husbands. 2585
       Am I a woodman, ha? Speak I like Herne the hunter?
       Why, now is Cupid a child of conscience; he makes
       restitution. As I am a true spirit, welcome!

   [Noise within]
     * Mistress Page. Alas, what noise? 2590

     * Mistress Ford. Heaven forgive our sins

     * Falstaff. What should this be?

     * Mistress Ford. [with Mistress Page] Away, away!

   [They run off]
     * Falstaff. I think the devil will not have me damned, lest the 2595
       oil that's in me should set hell on fire; he would
       never else cross me thus.
       [Enter SIR HUGH EVANS, disguised as before; PISTOL,]
       as Hobgoblin; MISTRESS QUICKLY, ANNE PAGE, and
       others, as Fairies, with tapers] 2600

     * Hostess Quickly. Fairies, black, grey, green, and white,
       You moonshine revellers and shades of night,
       You orphan heirs of fixed destiny,
       Attend your office and your quality.
       Crier Hobgoblin, make the fairy oyes. 2605

     * Pistol. Elves, list your names; silence, you airy toys.
       Cricket, to Windsor chimneys shalt thou leap:
       Where fires thou find'st unraked and hearths unswept,
       There pinch the maids as blue as bilberry:
       Our radiant queen hates sluts and sluttery. 2610

     * Falstaff. They are fairies; he that speaks to them shall die:
       I'll wink and couch: no man their works must eye.

   [Lies down upon his face]
     * Sir Hugh Evans. Where's Bede? Go you, and where you find a maid
       That, ere she sleep, has thrice her prayers said, 2615
       Raise up the organs of her fantasy;
       Sleep she as sound as careless infancy:
       But those as sleep and think not on their sins,
       Pinch them, arms, legs, backs, shoulders, sides and shins.

     * Hostess Quickly. About, about; 2620
       Search Windsor Castle, elves, within and out:
       Strew good luck, ouphes, on every sacred room:. That it may stand
       till the perpetual doom,
       In state as wholesome as in state 'tis fit,
       Worthy the owner, and the owner it.
       The several chairs of order look you scour 2625
       With juice of balm and every precious flower:
       Each fair instalment, coat, and several crest,
       With loyal blazon, evermore be blest!
       And nightly, meadow-fairies, look you sing,
       Like to the Garter's compass, in a ring: 2630
       The expressure that it bears, green let it be,
       More fertile-fresh than all the field to see;
       And 'Honi soit qui mal y pense' write
       In emerald tufts, flowers purple, blue and white;
       Let sapphire, pearl and rich embroidery, 2635
       Buckled below fair knighthood's bending knee:
       Fairies use flowers for their charactery.
       Away; disperse: but till 'tis one o'clock,
       Our dance of custom round about the oak
       Of Herne the hunter, let us not forget. 2640

     * Sir Hugh Evans. Pray you, lock hand in hand; yourselves in order
       set
       And twenty glow-worms shall our lanterns be,
       To guide our measure round about the tree.
       But, stay; I smell a man of middle-earth.

     * Falstaff. Heavens defend me from that Welsh fairy, lest he 2645
       transform me to a piece of cheese!

     * Pistol. Vile worm, thou wast o'erlook'd even in thy birth.

     * Hostess Quickly. With trial-fire touch me his finger-end:
       If he be chaste, the flame will back descend
       And turn him to no pain; but if he start, 2650
       It is the flesh of a corrupted heart.

     * Pistol. A trial, come.

     * Sir Hugh Evans. Come, will this wood take fire?

   [They burn him with their tapers]
     * Falstaff. Oh, Oh, Oh! 2655

     * Hostess Quickly. Corrupt, corrupt, and tainted in desire!
       About him, fairies; sing a scornful rhyme;
       And, as you trip, still pinch him to your time.
       SONG.
       Fie on sinful fantasy! 2660
       Fie on lust and luxury!
       Lust is but a bloody fire,
       Kindled with unchaste desire,
       Fed in heart, whose flames aspire
       As thoughts do blow them, higher and higher. 2665
       Pinch him, fairies, mutually;
       Pinch him for his villany;
       Pinch him, and burn him, and turn him about,
       Till candles and starlight and moonshine be out.
       [During this song they pinch FALSTAFF. DOCTOR CAIUS] 2670
       comes one way, and steals away a boy in green;
       SLENDER another way, and takes off a boy in white;
       and FENTON comes and steals away ANN PAGE.
       A noise of hunting is heard within. All the
       Fairies run away. FALSTAFF pulls off his buck's 2675
       head, and rises]

   [Enter PAGE, FORD, MISTRESS PAGE, and MISTRESS FORD]
     * Page. Nay, do not fly; I think we have watch'd you now
       Will none but Herne the hunter serve your turn?

     * Mistress Page. I pray you, come, hold up the jest no higher 2680
       Now, good Sir John, how like you Windsor wives?
       See you these, husband? do not these fair yokes
       Become the forest better than the town?

     * Ford. Now, sir, who's a cuckold now? Master Brook,
       Falstaff's a knave, a cuckoldly knave; here are his 2685
       horns, Master Brook: and, Master Brook, he hath
       enjoyed nothing of Ford's but his buck-basket, his
       cudgel, and twenty pounds of money, which must be
       paid to Master Brook; his horses are arrested for
       it, Master Brook. 2690

     * Mistress Ford. Sir John, we have had ill luck; we could never meet.
       I will never take you for my love again; but I will
       always count you my deer.

     * Falstaff. I do begin to perceive that I am made an ass.

     * Ford. Ay, and an ox too: both the proofs are extant. 2695

     * Falstaff. And these are not fairies? I was three or four
       times in the thought they were not fairies: and yet
       the guiltiness of my mind, the sudden surprise of my
       powers, drove the grossness of the foppery into a
       received belief, in despite of the teeth of all 2700
       rhyme and reason, that they were fairies. See now
       how wit may be made a Jack-a-Lent, when 'tis upon
       ill employment!

     * Sir Hugh Evans. Sir John Falstaff, serve Got, and leave your
       desires, and fairies will not pinse you. 2705

     * Ford. Well said, fairy Hugh.

     * Sir Hugh Evans. And leave your jealousies too, I pray you.

     * Ford. I will never mistrust my wife again till thou art
       able to woo her in good English.

     * Falstaff. Have I laid my brain in the sun and dried it, that 2710
       it wants matter to prevent so gross o'erreaching as
       this? Am I ridden with a Welsh goat too? shall I
       have a coxcomb of frize? 'Tis time I were choked
       with a piece of toasted cheese.

     * Sir Hugh Evans. Seese is not good to give putter; your belly is all
       putter. 2715

     * Falstaff. 'Seese' and 'putter'! have I lived to stand at the
       taunt of one that makes fritters of English? This
       is enough to be the decay of lust and late-walking
       through the realm.

     * Mistress Page. Why Sir John, do you think, though we would have the
       2720
       virtue out of our hearts by the head and shoulders
       and have given ourselves without scruple to hell,
       that ever the devil could have made you our delight?

     * Ford. What, a hodge-pudding? a bag of flax?

     * Mistress Page. A puffed man? 2725

     * Page. Old, cold, withered and of intolerable entrails?

     * Ford. And one that is as slanderous as Satan?

     * Page. And as poor as Job?

     * Ford. And as wicked as his wife?

     * Sir Hugh Evans. And given to fornications, and to taverns and sack
       2730
       and wine and metheglins, and to drinkings and
       swearings and starings, pribbles and prabbles?

     * Falstaff. Well, I am your theme: you have the start of me; I
       am dejected; I am not able to answer the Welsh
       flannel; ignorance itself is a plummet o'er me: use 2735
       me as you will.

     * Ford. Marry, sir, we'll bring you to Windsor, to one
       Master Brook, that you have cozened of money, to
       whom you should have been a pander: over and above
       that you have suffered, I think to repay that money 2740
       will be a biting affliction.

     * Page. Yet be cheerful, knight: thou shalt eat a posset
       to-night at my house; where I will desire thee to
       laugh at my wife, that now laughs at thee: tell her
       Master Slender hath married her daughter. 2745

     * Mistress Page. [Aside] Doctors doubt that: if Anne Page be my
       daughter, she is, by this, Doctor Caius' wife.

   [Enter SLENDER]
     * Slender. Whoa ho! ho, father Page!

     * Page. Son, how now! how now, son! have you dispatched? 2750

     * Slender. Dispatched! I'll make the best in Gloucestershire
       know on't; would I were hanged, la, else.

     * Page. Of what, son?

     * Slender. I came yonder at Eton to marry Mistress Anne Page,
       and she's a great lubberly boy. If it had not been 2755
       i' the church, I would have swinged him, or he
       should have swinged me. If I did not think it had
       been Anne Page, would I might never stir!—and 'tis
       a postmaster's boy.

     * Page. Upon my life, then, you took the wrong. 2760

     * Slender. What need you tell me that? I think so, when I took
       a boy for a girl. If I had been married to him, for
       all he was in woman's apparel, I would not have had
       him.

     * Page. Why, this is your own folly. Did not I tell you how 2765
       you should know my daughter by her garments?

     * Slender. I went to her in white, and cried 'mum,' and she
       cried 'budget,' as Anne and I had appointed; and yet
       it was not Anne, but a postmaster's boy.

     * Mistress Page. Good George, be not angry: I knew of your purpose;
       2770
       turned my daughter into green; and, indeed, she is
       now with the doctor at the deanery, and there married.

   [Enter DOCTOR CAIUS]
     * Doctor Caius. Vere is Mistress Page? By gar, I am cozened: I ha'
       married un garcon, a boy; un paysan, by gar, a boy; 2775
       it is not Anne Page: by gar, I am cozened.

     * Mistress Page. Why, did you take her in green?

     * Doctor Caius. Ay, by gar, and 'tis a boy: by gar, I'll raise all
       Windsor.

   [Exit]
     * Ford. This is strange. Who hath got the right Anne? 2780

     * Page. My heart misgives me: here comes Master Fenton.
       [Enter FENTON and ANNE PAGE]
       How now, Master Fenton!

     * Anne Page. Pardon, good father! good my mother, pardon!

     * Page. Now, mistress, how chance you went not with Master Slender?
       2785

     * Mistress Page. Why went you not with master doctor, maid?

     * Fenton. You do amaze her: hear the truth of it.
       You would have married her most shamefully,
       Where there was no proportion held in love.
       The truth is, she and I, long since contracted, 2790
       Are now so sure that nothing can dissolve us.
       The offence is holy that she hath committed;
       And this deceit loses the name of craft,
       Of disobedience, or unduteous title,
       Since therein she doth evitate and shun 2795
       A thousand irreligious cursed hours,
       Which forced marriage would have brought upon her.

     * Ford. Stand not amazed; here is no remedy:
       In love the heavens themselves do guide the state;
       Money buys lands, and wives are sold by fate. 2800

     * Falstaff. I am glad, though you have ta'en a special stand to
       strike at me, that your arrow hath glanced.

     * Page. Well, what remedy? Fenton, heaven give thee joy!
       What cannot be eschew'd must be embraced.

     * Falstaff. When night-dogs run, all sorts of deer are chased. 2805

     * Mistress Page. Well, I will muse no further. Master Fenton,
       Heaven give you many, many merry days!
       Good husband, let us every one go home,
       And laugh this sport o'er by a country fire;
       Sir John and all. 2810

     * Ford. Let it be so. Sir John,
       To Master Brook you yet shall hold your word
       For he tonight shall lie with Mistress Ford.

   [Exeunt]
