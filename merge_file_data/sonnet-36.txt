                                SONNET XXXVI

                  Let me confess that we two must be twain,
                    Although our undivided loves are one:
                 So shall those blots that do with me remain
                   Without thy help by me be borne alone.
                In our two loves there is but one respect, 5
                   Though in our lives a separable spite,
                Which though it alter not love's sole effect,
             Yet doth it steal sweet hours from love's delight.
                    I may not evermore acknowledge thee,
               Lest my bewailed guilt should do thee shame, 10
                  Nor thou with public kindness honour me,
                 Unless thou take that honour from thy name:
                     But do not so; I love thee in such sort
                As, thou being mine, mine is thy good report. 14
