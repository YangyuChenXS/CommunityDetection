                                 SONNET XXI

                   So is it not with me as with that Muse
                  Stirr'd by a painted beauty to his verse,
                   Who heaven itself for ornament doth use
                 And every fair with his fair doth rehearse
                   Making a couplement of proud compare, 5
             With sun and moon, with earth and sea's rich gems,
            With April's first-born flowers, and all things rare
                That heaven's air in this huge rondure hems.
                  O' let me, true in love, but truly write,
                 And then believe me, my love is as fair 10
                 As any mother's child, though not so bright
                As those gold candles fix'd in heaven's air:
                  Let them say more than like of hearsay well;
                 I will not praise that purpose not to sell. 14

                                      O
