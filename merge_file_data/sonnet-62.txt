                                 SONNET LXII

                  Sin of self-love possesseth all mine eye
                   And all my soul and all my every part;
                    And for this sin there is no remedy,
                    It is so grounded inward in my heart.
                 Methinks no face so gracious is as mine, 5
                 No shape so true, no truth of such account;
                  And for myself mine own worth do define,
                   As I all other in all worths surmount.
                  But when my glass shows me myself indeed,
                Beated and chopp'd with tann'd antiquity, 10
                  Mine own self-love quite contrary I read;
                     Self so self-loving were iniquity.
                  'Tis thee, myself, that for myself I praise,
                   Painting my age with beauty of thy days. 14
