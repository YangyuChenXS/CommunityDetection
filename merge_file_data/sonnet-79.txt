                                SONNET LXXIX

                    Whilst I alone did call upon thy aid,
                  My verse alone had all thy gentle grace,
                   But now my gracious numbers are decay'd
                  And my sick Muse doth give another place.
                 I grant, sweet love, thy lovely argument 5
                   Deserves the travail of a worthier pen,
                    Yet what of thee thy poet doth invent
                   He robs thee of and pays it thee again.
                 He lends thee virtue and he stole that word
                  From thy behavior; beauty doth he give 10
                  And found it in thy cheek; he can afford
                No praise to thee but what in thee doth live.
                 Then thank him not for that which he doth say,
                Since what he owes thee thou thyself dost pay. 14
