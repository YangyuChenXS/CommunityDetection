                                 SONNET XIX

                 Devouring Time, blunt thou the lion's paws,
               And make the earth devour her own sweet brood;
             Pluck the keen teeth from the fierce tiger's jaws,
                And burn the long-lived phoenix in her blood;
                Make glad and sorry seasons as thou fleets, 5
                And do whate'er thou wilt, swift-footed Time,
                To the wide world and all her fading sweets;
                  But I forbid thee one most heinous crime:
              O, carve not with thy hours my love's fair brow,
             Nor draw no lines there with thine antique pen; 10
                    Him in thy course untainted do allow
                   For beauty's pattern to succeeding men.
                 Yet, do thy worst, old Time: despite thy wrong,
                  My love shall in my verse ever live young. 14

                                      O
