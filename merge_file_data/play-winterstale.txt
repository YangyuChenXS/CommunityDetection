   Act I, Scene 1

   Antechamber in LEONTES’ palace.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   [Enter CAMILLO and ARCHIDAMUS]
     * Archidamus. If you shall chance, Camillo, to visit Bohemia, on
       the like occasion whereon my services are now on
       foot, you shall see, as I have said, great
       difference betwixt our Bohemia and your Sicilia. 5

     * Camillo. I think, this coming summer, the King of Sicilia
       means to pay Bohemia the visitation which he justly owes him.

     * Archidamus. Wherein our entertainment shall shame us we will be
       justified in our loves; for indeed—

     * Camillo. Beseech you,— 10

     * Archidamus. Verily, I speak it in the freedom of my knowledge:
       we cannot with such magnificence—in so rare—I know
       not what to say. We will give you sleepy drinks,
       that your senses, unintelligent of our insufficience,
       may, though they cannot praise us, as little accuse 15
       us.

     * Camillo. You pay a great deal too dear for what's given freely.

     * Archidamus. Believe me, I speak as my understanding instructs me
       and as mine honesty puts it to utterance.

     * Camillo. Sicilia cannot show himself over-kind to Bohemia. 20
       They were trained together in their childhoods; and
       there rooted betwixt them then such an affection,
       which cannot choose but branch now. Since their
       more mature dignities and royal necessities made
       separation of their society, their encounters, 25
       though not personal, have been royally attorneyed
       with interchange of gifts, letters, loving
       embassies; that they have seemed to be together,
       though absent, shook hands, as over a vast, and
       embraced, as it were, from the ends of opposed 30
       winds. The heavens continue their loves!

     * Archidamus. I think there is not in the world either malice or
       matter to alter it. You have an unspeakable
       comfort of your young prince Mamillius: it is a
       gentleman of the greatest promise that ever came 35
       into my note.

     * Camillo. I very well agree with you in the hopes of him: it
       is a gallant child; one that indeed physics the
       subject, makes old hearts fresh: they that went on
       crutches ere he was born desire yet their life to 40
       see him a man.

     * Archidamus. Would they else be content to die?

     * Camillo. Yes; if there were no other excuse why they should
       desire to live.

     * Archidamus. If the king had no son, they would desire to live 45
       on crutches till he had one.

   [Exeunt]

   Act I, Scene 2

   A room of state in the same.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   [Enter LEONTES, HERMIONE, MAMILLIUS,] [p]POLIXENES, CAMILLO, and
   Attendants]
     * Polixenes. Nine changes of the watery star hath been 50
       The shepherd's note since we have left our throne
       Without a burthen: time as long again
       Would be find up, my brother, with our thanks;
       And yet we should, for perpetuity,
       Go hence in debt: and therefore, like a cipher, 55
       Yet standing in rich place, I multiply
       With one 'We thank you' many thousands moe
       That go before it.

     * Leontes. Stay your thanks a while;
       And pay them when you part. 60

     * Polixenes. Sir, that's to-morrow.
       I am question'd by my fears, of what may chance
       Or breed upon our absence; that may blow
       No sneaping winds at home, to make us say
       'This is put forth too truly:' besides, I have stay'd 65
       To tire your royalty.

     * Leontes. We are tougher, brother,
       Than you can put us to't.

     * Polixenes. No longer stay.

     * Leontes. One seven-night longer. 70

     * Polixenes. Very sooth, to-morrow.

     * Leontes. We'll part the time between's then; and in that
       I'll no gainsaying.

     * Polixenes. Press me not, beseech you, so.
       There is no tongue that moves, none, none i' the world, 75
       So soon as yours could win me: so it should now,
       Were there necessity in your request, although
       'Twere needful I denied it. My affairs
       Do even drag me homeward: which to hinder
       Were in your love a whip to me; my stay 80
       To you a charge and trouble: to save both,
       Farewell, our brother.

     * Leontes. Tongue-tied, our queen?
       speak you.

     * Hermione. I had thought, sir, to have held my peace until 85
       You have drawn oaths from him not to stay. You, sir,
       Charge him too coldly. Tell him, you are sure
       All in Bohemia's well; this satisfaction
       The by-gone day proclaim'd: say this to him,
       He's beat from his best ward. 90

     * Leontes. Well said, Hermione.

     * Hermione. To tell, he longs to see his son, were strong:
       But let him say so then, and let him go;
       But let him swear so, and he shall not stay,
       We'll thwack him hence with distaffs. 95
       Yet of your royal presence I'll adventure
       The borrow of a week. When at Bohemia
       You take my lord, I'll give him my commission
       To let him there a month behind the gest
       Prefix'd for's parting: yet, good deed, Leontes, 100
       I love thee not a jar o' the clock behind
       What lady-she her lord. You'll stay?

     * Polixenes. No, madam.

     * Hermione. Nay, but you will?

     * Polixenes. I may not, verily. 105

     * Hermione. Verily!
       You put me off with limber vows; but I,
       Though you would seek to unsphere the
       stars with oaths,
       Should yet say 'Sir, no going.' Verily, 110
       You shall not go: a lady's 'Verily' 's
       As potent as a lord's. Will you go yet?
       Force me to keep you as a prisoner,
       Not like a guest; so you shall pay your fees
       When you depart, and save your thanks. How say you? 115
       My prisoner? or my guest? by your dread 'Verily,'
       One of them you shall be.

     * Polixenes. Your guest, then, madam:
       To be your prisoner should import offending;
       Which is for me less easy to commit 120
       Than you to punish.

     * Hermione. Not your gaoler, then,
       But your kind hostess. Come, I'll question you
       Of my lord's tricks and yours when you were boys:
       You were pretty lordings then? 125

     * Polixenes. We were, fair queen,
       Two lads that thought there was no more behind
       But such a day to-morrow as to-day,
       And to be boy eternal.

     * Hermione. Was not my lord 130
       The verier wag o' the two?

     * Polixenes. We were as twinn'd lambs that did frisk i' the sun,
       And bleat the one at the other: what we changed
       Was innocence for innocence; we knew not
       The doctrine of ill-doing, nor dream'd 135
       That any did. Had we pursued that life,
       And our weak spirits ne'er been higher rear'd
       With stronger blood, we should have answer'd heaven
       Boldly 'not guilty;' the imposition clear'd
       Hereditary ours. 140

     * Hermione. By this we gather
       You have tripp'd since.

     * Polixenes. O my most sacred lady!
       Temptations have since then been born to's; for
       In those unfledged days was my wife a girl; 145
       Your precious self had then not cross'd the eyes
       Of my young play-fellow.

     * Hermione. Grace to boot!
       Of this make no conclusion, lest you say
       Your queen and I are devils: yet go on; 150
       The offences we have made you do we'll answer,
       If you first sinn'd with us and that with us
       You did continue fault and that you slipp'd not
       With any but with us.

     * Leontes. Is he won yet? 155

     * Hermione. He'll stay my lord.

     * Leontes. At my request he would not.
       Hermione, my dearest, thou never spokest
       To better purpose.

     * Hermione. Never? 160

     * Leontes. Never, but once.

     * Hermione. What! have I twice said well? when was't before?
       I prithee tell me; cram's with praise, and make's
       As fat as tame things: one good deed dying tongueless
       Slaughters a thousand waiting upon that. 165
       Our praises are our wages: you may ride's
       With one soft kiss a thousand furlongs ere
       With spur we beat an acre. But to the goal:
       My last good deed was to entreat his stay:
       What was my first? it has an elder sister, 170
       Or I mistake you: O, would her name were Grace!
       But once before I spoke to the purpose: when?
       Nay, let me have't; I long.

     * Leontes. Why, that was when
       Three crabbed months had sour'd themselves to death, 175
       Ere I could make thee open thy white hand
       And clap thyself my love: then didst thou utter
       'I am yours for ever.'

     * Hermione. 'Tis grace indeed.
       Why, lo you now, I have spoke to the purpose twice: 180
       The one for ever earn'd a royal husband;
       The other for some while a friend.

     * Leontes. [Aside]. Too hot, too hot!
       To mingle friendship far is mingling bloods.
       I have tremor cordis on me: my heart dances; 185
       But not for joy; not joy. This entertainment
       May a free face put on, derive a liberty
       From heartiness, from bounty, fertile bosom,
       And well become the agent; 't may, I grant;
       But to be paddling palms and pinching fingers, 190
       As now they are, and making practised smiles,
       As in a looking-glass, and then to sigh, as 'twere
       The mort o' the deer; O, that is entertainment
       My bosom likes not, nor my brows! Mamillius,
       Art thou my boy? 195

     * Mamillius. Ay, my good lord.

     * Leontes. I' fecks!
       Why, that's my bawcock. What, hast
       smutch'd thy nose?
       They say it is a copy out of mine. Come, captain, 200
       We must be neat; not neat, but cleanly, captain:
       And yet the steer, the heifer and the calf
       Are all call'd neat.—Still virginalling
       Upon his palm!—How now, you wanton calf!
       Art thou my calf? 205

     * Mamillius. Yes, if you will, my lord.

     * Leontes. Thou want'st a rough pash and the shoots that I have,
       To be full like me: yet they say we are
       Almost as like as eggs; women say so,
       That will say anything but were they false 210
       As o'er-dyed blacks, as wind, as waters, false
       As dice are to be wish'd by one that fixes
       No bourn 'twixt his and mine, yet were it true
       To say this boy were like me. Come, sir page,
       Look on me with your welkin eye: sweet villain! 215
       Most dear'st! my collop! Can thy dam?—may't be?—
       Affection! thy intention stabs the centre:
       Thou dost make possible things not so held,
       Communicatest with dreams;—how can this be?—
       With what's unreal thou coactive art, 220
       And fellow'st nothing: then 'tis very credent
       Thou mayst co-join with something; and thou dost,
       And that beyond commission, and I find it,
       And that to the infection of my brains
       And hardening of my brows. 225

     * Polixenes. What means Sicilia?

     * Hermione. He something seems unsettled.

     * Polixenes. How, my lord!
       What cheer? how is't with you, best brother?

     * Hermione. You look as if you held a brow of much distraction 230
       Are you moved, my lord?

     * Leontes. No, in good earnest.
       How sometimes nature will betray its folly,
       Its tenderness, and make itself a pastime
       To harder bosoms! Looking on the lines 235
       Of my boy's face, methoughts I did recoil
       Twenty-three years, and saw myself unbreech'd,
       In my green velvet coat, my dagger muzzled,
       Lest it should bite its master, and so prove,
       As ornaments oft do, too dangerous: 240
       How like, methought, I then was to this kernel,
       This squash, this gentleman. Mine honest friend,
       Will you take eggs for money?

     * Mamillius. No, my lord, I'll fight.

     * Leontes. You will! why, happy man be's dole! My brother, 245
       Are you so fond of your young prince as we
       Do seem to be of ours?

     * Polixenes. If at home, sir,
       He's all my exercise, my mirth, my matter,
       Now my sworn friend and then mine enemy, 250
       My parasite, my soldier, statesman, all:
       He makes a July's day short as December,
       And with his varying childness cures in me
       Thoughts that would thick my blood.

     * Leontes. So stands this squire 255
       Officed with me: we two will walk, my lord,
       And leave you to your graver steps. Hermione,
       How thou lovest us, show in our brother's welcome;
       Let what is dear in Sicily be cheap:
       Next to thyself and my young rover, he's 260
       Apparent to my heart.

     * Hermione. If you would seek us,
       We are yours i' the garden: shall's attend you there?

     * Leontes. To your own bents dispose you: you'll be found,
       Be you beneath the sky. 265
       [Aside]
       I am angling now,
       Though you perceive me not how I give line.
       Go to, go to!
       How she holds up the neb, the bill to him! 270
       And arms her with the boldness of a wife
       To her allowing husband!
       [Exeunt POLIXENES, HERMIONE, and Attendants]
       Gone already!
       Inch-thick, knee-deep, o'er head and 275
       ears a fork'd one!
       Go, play, boy, play: thy mother plays, and I
       Play too, but so disgraced a part, whose issue
       Will hiss me to my grave: contempt and clamour
       Will be my knell. Go, play, boy, play. 280
       There have been,
       Or I am much deceived, cuckolds ere now;
       And many a man there is, even at this present,
       Now while I speak this, holds his wife by the arm,
       That little thinks she has been sluiced in's absence 285
       And his pond fish'd by his next neighbour, by
       Sir Smile, his neighbour: nay, there's comfort in't
       Whiles other men have gates and those gates open'd,
       As mine, against their will. Should all despair
       That have revolted wives, the tenth of mankind 290
       Would hang themselves. Physic for't there is none;
       It is a bawdy planet, that will strike
       Where 'tis predominant; and 'tis powerful, think it,
       From east, west, north and south: be it concluded,
       No barricado for a belly; know't; 295
       It will let in and out the enemy
       With bag and baggage: many thousand on's
       Have the disease, and feel't not. How now, boy!

     * Mamillius. I am like you, they say.

     * Leontes. Why that's some comfort. What, Camillo there? 300

     * Camillo. Ay, my good lord.

     * Leontes. Go play, Mamillius; thou'rt an honest man.
       [Exit MAMILLIUS]
       Camillo, this great sir will yet stay longer.

     * Camillo. You had much ado to make his anchor hold: 305
       When you cast out, it still came home.

     * Leontes. Didst note it?

     * Camillo. He would not stay at your petitions: made
       His business more material.

     * Leontes. Didst perceive it? 310
       [Aside]
       They're here with me already, whispering, rounding
       'Sicilia is a so-forth:' 'tis far gone,
       When I shall gust it last. How came't, Camillo,
       That he did stay? 315

     * Camillo. At the good queen's entreaty.

     * Leontes. At the queen's be't: 'good' should be pertinent
       But, so it is, it is not. Was this taken
       By any understanding pate but thine?
       For thy conceit is soaking, will draw in 320
       More than the common blocks: not noted, is't,
       But of the finer natures? by some severals
       Of head-piece extraordinary? lower messes
       Perchance are to this business purblind? say.

     * Camillo. Business, my lord! I think most understand 325
       Bohemia stays here longer.

     * Leontes. Ha!

     * Camillo. Stays here longer.

     * Leontes. Ay, but why?

     * Camillo. To satisfy your highness and the entreaties 330
       Of our most gracious mistress.

     * Leontes. Satisfy!
       The entreaties of your mistress! satisfy!
       Let that suffice. I have trusted thee, Camillo,
       With all the nearest things to my heart, as well 335
       My chamber-councils, wherein, priest-like, thou
       Hast cleansed my bosom, I from thee departed
       Thy penitent reform'd: but we have been
       Deceived in thy integrity, deceived
       In that which seems so. 340

     * Camillo. Be it forbid, my lord!

     * Leontes. To bide upon't, thou art not honest, or,
       If thou inclinest that way, thou art a coward,
       Which hoxes honesty behind, restraining
       From course required; or else thou must be counted 345
       A servant grafted in my serious trust
       And therein negligent; or else a fool
       That seest a game play'd home, the rich stake drawn,
       And takest it all for jest.

     * Camillo. My gracious lord, 350
       I may be negligent, foolish and fearful;
       In every one of these no man is free,
       But that his negligence, his folly, fear,
       Among the infinite doings of the world,
       Sometime puts forth. In your affairs, my lord, 355
       If ever I were wilful-negligent,
       It was my folly; if industriously
       I play'd the fool, it was my negligence,
       Not weighing well the end; if ever fearful
       To do a thing, where I the issue doubted, 360
       Where of the execution did cry out
       Against the non-performance, 'twas a fear
       Which oft infects the wisest: these, my lord,
       Are such allow'd infirmities that honesty
       Is never free of. But, beseech your grace, 365
       Be plainer with me; let me know my trespass
       By its own visage: if I then deny it,
       'Tis none of mine.

     * Leontes. Ha' not you seen, Camillo,—
       But that's past doubt, you have, or your eye-glass 370
       Is thicker than a cuckold's horn,—or heard,—
       For to a vision so apparent rumour
       Cannot be mute,—or thought,—for cogitation
       Resides not in that man that does not think,—
       My wife is slippery? If thou wilt confess, 375
       Or else be impudently negative,
       To have nor eyes nor ears nor thought, then say
       My wife's a hobby-horse, deserves a name
       As rank as any flax-wench that puts to
       Before her troth-plight: say't and justify't. 380

     * Camillo. I would not be a stander-by to hear
       My sovereign mistress clouded so, without
       My present vengeance taken: 'shrew my heart,
       You never spoke what did become you less
       Than this; which to reiterate were sin 385
       As deep as that, though true.

     * Leontes. Is whispering nothing?
       Is leaning cheek to cheek? is meeting noses?
       Kissing with inside lip? stopping the career
       Of laughing with a sigh?—a note infallible 390
       Of breaking honesty—horsing foot on foot?
       Skulking in corners? wishing clocks more swift?
       Hours, minutes? noon, midnight? and all eyes
       Blind with the pin and web but theirs, theirs only,
       That would unseen be wicked? is this nothing? 395
       Why, then the world and all that's in't is nothing;
       The covering sky is nothing; Bohemia nothing;
       My wife is nothing; nor nothing have these nothings,
       If this be nothing.

     * Camillo. Good my lord, be cured 400
       Of this diseased opinion, and betimes;
       For 'tis most dangerous.

     * Leontes. Say it be, 'tis true.

     * Camillo. No, no, my lord.

     * Leontes. It is; you lie, you lie: 405
       I say thou liest, Camillo, and I hate thee,
       Pronounce thee a gross lout, a mindless slave,
       Or else a hovering temporizer, that
       Canst with thine eyes at once see good and evil,
       Inclining to them both: were my wife's liver 410
       Infected as her life, she would not live
       The running of one glass.

     * Camillo. Who does infect her?

     * Leontes. Why, he that wears her like a medal, hanging
       About his neck, Bohemia: who, if I 415
       Had servants true about me, that bare eyes
       To see alike mine honour as their profits,
       Their own particular thrifts, they would do that
       Which should undo more doing: ay, and thou,
       His cupbearer,—whom I from meaner form 420
       Have benched and reared to worship, who mayst see
       Plainly as heaven sees earth and earth sees heaven,
       How I am galled,—mightst bespice a cup,
       To give mine enemy a lasting wink;
       Which draught to me were cordial. 425

     * Camillo. Sir, my lord,
       I could do this, and that with no rash potion,
       But with a lingering dram that should not work
       Maliciously like poison: but I cannot
       Believe this crack to be in my dread mistress, 430
       So sovereignly being honourable.
       I have loved thee,—

     * Leontes. Make that thy question, and go rot!
       Dost think I am so muddy, so unsettled,
       To appoint myself in this vexation, sully 435
       The purity and whiteness of my sheets,
       Which to preserve is sleep, which being spotted
       Is goads, thorns, nettles, tails of wasps,
       Give scandal to the blood o' the prince my son,
       Who I do think is mine and love as mine, 440
       Without ripe moving to't? Would I do this?
       Could man so blench?

     * Camillo. I must believe you, sir:
       I do; and will fetch off Bohemia for't;
       Provided that, when he's removed, your highness 445
       Will take again your queen as yours at first,
       Even for your son's sake; and thereby for sealing
       The injury of tongues in courts and kingdoms
       Known and allied to yours.

     * Leontes. Thou dost advise me 450
       Even so as I mine own course have set down:
       I'll give no blemish to her honour, none.

     * Camillo. My lord,
       Go then; and with a countenance as clear
       As friendship wears at feasts, keep with Bohemia 455
       And with your queen. I am his cupbearer:
       If from me he have wholesome beverage,
       Account me not your servant.

     * Leontes. This is all:
       Do't and thou hast the one half of my heart; 460
       Do't not, thou split'st thine own.

     * Camillo. I'll do't, my lord.

     * Leontes. I will seem friendly, as thou hast advised me.

   [Exit]
     * Camillo. O miserable lady! But, for me, 465
       What case stand I in? I must be the poisoner
       Of good Polixenes; and my ground to do't
       Is the obedience to a master, one
       Who in rebellion with himself will have
       All that are his so too. To do this deed, 470
       Promotion follows. If I could find example
       Of thousands that had struck anointed kings
       And flourish'd after, I'ld not do't; but since
       Nor brass nor stone nor parchment bears not one,
       Let villany itself forswear't. I must 475
       Forsake the court: to do't, or no, is certain
       To me a break-neck. Happy star, reign now!
       Here comes Bohemia.

   [Re-enter POLIXENES]
     * Polixenes. This is strange: methinks 480
       My favour here begins to warp. Not speak?
       Good day, Camillo.

     * Camillo. Hail, most royal sir!

     * Polixenes. What is the news i' the court?

     * Camillo. None rare, my lord. 485

     * Polixenes. The king hath on him such a countenance
       As he had lost some province and a region
       Loved as he loves himself: even now I met him
       With customary compliment; when he,
       Wafting his eyes to the contrary and falling 490
       A lip of much contempt, speeds from me and
       So leaves me to consider what is breeding
       That changeth thus his manners.

     * Camillo. I dare not know, my lord.

     * Polixenes. How! dare not! do not. Do you know, and dare not? 495
       Be intelligent to me: 'tis thereabouts;
       For, to yourself, what you do know, you must.
       And cannot say, you dare not. Good Camillo,
       Your changed complexions are to me a mirror
       Which shows me mine changed too; for I must be 500
       A party in this alteration, finding
       Myself thus alter'd with 't.

     * Camillo. There is a sickness
       Which puts some of us in distemper, but
       I cannot name the disease; and it is caught 505
       Of you that yet are well.

     * Polixenes. How! caught of me!
       Make me not sighted like the basilisk:
       I have look'd on thousands, who have sped the better
       By my regard, but kill'd none so. Camillo,— 510
       As you are certainly a gentleman, thereto
       Clerk-like experienced, which no less adorns
       Our gentry than our parents' noble names,
       In whose success we are gentle,—I beseech you,
       If you know aught which does behove my knowledge 515
       Thereof to be inform'd, imprison't not
       In ignorant concealment.

     * Camillo. I may not answer.

     * Polixenes. A sickness caught of me, and yet I well!
       I must be answer'd. Dost thou hear, Camillo, 520
       I conjure thee, by all the parts of man
       Which honour does acknowledge, whereof the least
       Is not this suit of mine, that thou declare
       What incidency thou dost guess of harm
       Is creeping toward me; how far off, how near; 525
       Which way to be prevented, if to be;
       If not, how best to bear it.

     * Camillo. Sir, I will tell you;
       Since I am charged in honour and by him
       That I think honourable: therefore mark my counsel, 530
       Which must be even as swiftly follow'd as
       I mean to utter it, or both yourself and me
       Cry lost, and so good night!

     * Polixenes. On, good Camillo.

     * Camillo. I am appointed him to murder you. 535

     * Polixenes. By whom, Camillo?

     * Camillo. By the king.

     * Polixenes. For what?

     * Camillo. He thinks, nay, with all confidence he swears,
       As he had seen't or been an instrument 540
       To vice you to't, that you have touch'd his queen
       Forbiddenly.

     * Polixenes. O, then my best blood turn
       To an infected jelly and my name
       Be yoked with his that did betray the Best! 545
       Turn then my freshest reputation to
       A savour that may strike the dullest nostril
       Where I arrive, and my approach be shunn'd,
       Nay, hated too, worse than the great'st infection
       That e'er was heard or read! 550

     * Camillo. Swear his thought over
       By each particular star in heaven and
       By all their influences, you may as well
       Forbid the sea for to obey the moon
       As or by oath remove or counsel shake 555
       The fabric of his folly, whose foundation
       Is piled upon his faith and will continue
       The standing of his body.

     * Polixenes. How should this grow?

     * Camillo. I know not: but I am sure 'tis safer to 560
       Avoid what's grown than question how 'tis born.
       If therefore you dare trust my honesty,
       That lies enclosed in this trunk which you
       Shall bear along impawn'd, away to-night!
       Your followers I will whisper to the business, 565
       And will by twos and threes at several posterns
       Clear them o' the city. For myself, I'll put
       My fortunes to your service, which are here
       By this discovery lost. Be not uncertain;
       For, by the honour of my parents, I 570
       Have utter'd truth: which if you seek to prove,
       I dare not stand by; nor shall you be safer
       Than one condemn'd by the king's own mouth, thereon
       His execution sworn.

     * Polixenes. I do believe thee: 575
       I saw his heart in 's face. Give me thy hand:
       Be pilot to me and thy places shall
       Still neighbour mine. My ships are ready and
       My people did expect my hence departure
       Two days ago. This jealousy 580
       Is for a precious creature: as she's rare,
       Must it be great, and as his person's mighty,
       Must it be violent, and as he does conceive
       He is dishonour'd by a man which ever
       Profess'd to him, why, his revenges must 585
       In that be made more bitter. Fear o'ershades me:
       Good expedition be my friend, and comfort
       The gracious queen, part of his theme, but nothing
       Of his ill-ta'en suspicion! Come, Camillo;
       I will respect thee as a father if 590
       Thou bear'st my life off hence: let us avoid.

     * Camillo. It is in mine authority to command
       The keys of all the posterns: please your highness
       To take the urgent hour. Come, sir, away.

   [Exeunt]

   Act II, Scene 1

   A room in LEONTES’ palace.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   [Enter HERMIONE, MAMILLIUS, and Ladies]
     * Hermione. Take the boy to you: he so troubles me,
       'Tis past enduring.

     * First Lady. Come, my gracious lord,
       Shall I be your playfellow? 600

     * Mamillius. No, I'll none of you.

     * First Lady. Why, my sweet lord?

     * Mamillius. You'll kiss me hard and speak to me as if
       I were a baby still. I love you better.

     * Second Lady. And why so, my lord? 605

     * Mamillius. Not for because
       Your brows are blacker; yet black brows, they say,
       Become some women best, so that there be not
       Too much hair there, but in a semicircle
       Or a half-moon made with a pen. 610

     * Second Lady. Who taught you this?

     * Mamillius. I learnt it out of women's faces. Pray now
       What colour are your eyebrows?

     * First Lady. Blue, my lord.

     * Mamillius. Nay, that's a mock: I have seen a lady's nose 615
       That has been blue, but not her eyebrows.

     * First Lady. Hark ye;
       The queen your mother rounds apace: we shall
       Present our services to a fine new prince
       One of these days; and then you'ld wanton with us, 620
       If we would have you.

     * Second Lady. She is spread of late
       Into a goodly bulk: good time encounter her!

     * Hermione. What wisdom stirs amongst you? Come, sir, now
       I am for you again: pray you, sit by us, 625
       And tell 's a tale.

     * Mamillius. Merry or sad shall't be?

     * Hermione. As merry as you will.

     * Mamillius. A sad tale's best for winter: I have one
       Of sprites and goblins. 630

     * Hermione. Let's have that, good sir.
       Come on, sit down: come on, and do your best
       To fright me with your sprites; you're powerful at it.

     * Mamillius. There was a man—

     * Hermione. Nay, come, sit down; then on. 635

     * Mamillius. Dwelt by a churchyard: I will tell it softly;
       Yond crickets shall not hear it.

     * Hermione. Come on, then,
       And give't me in mine ear.

   [Enter LEONTES, with ANTIGONUS, Lords and others]
     * Leontes. Was he met there? his train? Camillo with him?

     * First Lord. Behind the tuft of pines I met them; never
       Saw I men scour so on their way: I eyed them
       Even to their ships.

     * Leontes. How blest am I 645
       In my just censure, in my true opinion!
       Alack, for lesser knowledge! how accursed
       In being so blest! There may be in the cup
       A spider steep'd, and one may drink, depart,
       And yet partake no venom, for his knowledge 650
       Is not infected: but if one present
       The abhorr'd ingredient to his eye, make known
       How he hath drunk, he cracks his gorge, his sides,
       With violent hefts. I have drunk,
       and seen the spider. 655
       Camillo was his help in this, his pander:
       There is a plot against my life, my crown;
       All's true that is mistrusted: that false villain
       Whom I employ'd was pre-employ'd by him:
       He has discover'd my design, and I 660
       Remain a pinch'd thing; yea, a very trick
       For them to play at will. How came the posterns
       So easily open?

     * First Lord. By his great authority;
       Which often hath no less prevail'd than so 665
       On your command.

     * Leontes. I know't too well.
       Give me the boy: I am glad you did not nurse him:
       Though he does bear some signs of me, yet you
       Have too much blood in him. 670

     * Hermione. What is this? sport?

     * Leontes. Bear the boy hence; he shall not come about her;
       Away with him! and let her sport herself
       With that she's big with; for 'tis Polixenes
       Has made thee swell thus. 675

     * Hermione. But I'ld say he had not,
       And I'll be sworn you would believe my saying,
       Howe'er you lean to the nayward.

     * Leontes. You, my lords,
       Look on her, mark her well; be but about 680
       To say 'she is a goodly lady,' and
       The justice of your bearts will thereto add
       'Tis pity she's not honest, honourable:'
       Praise her but for this her without-door form,
       Which on my faith deserves high speech, and straight 685
       The shrug, the hum or ha, these petty brands
       That calumny doth use—O, I am out—
       That mercy does, for calumny will sear
       Virtue itself: these shrugs, these hums and ha's,
       When you have said 'she's goodly,' come between 690
       Ere you can say 'she's honest:' but be 't known,
       From him that has most cause to grieve it should be,
       She's an adulteress.

     * Hermione. Should a villain say so,
       The most replenish'd villain in the world, 695
       He were as much more villain: you, my lord,
       Do but mistake.

     * Leontes. You have mistook, my lady,
       Polixenes for Leontes: O thou thing!
       Which I'll not call a creature of thy place, 700
       Lest barbarism, making me the precedent,
       Should a like language use to all degrees
       And mannerly distinguishment leave out
       Betwixt the prince and beggar: I have said
       She's an adulteress; I have said with whom: 705
       More, she's a traitor and Camillo is
       A federary with her, and one that knows
       What she should shame to know herself
       But with her most vile principal, that she's
       A bed-swerver, even as bad as those 710
       That vulgars give bold'st titles, ay, and privy
       To this their late escape.

     * Hermione. No, by my life.
       Privy to none of this. How will this grieve you,
       When you shall come to clearer knowledge, that 715
       You thus have publish'd me! Gentle my lord,
       You scarce can right me throughly then to say
       You did mistake.

     * Leontes. No; if I mistake
       In those foundations which I build upon, 720
       The centre is not big enough to bear
       A school-boy's top. Away with her! to prison!
       He who shall speak for her is afar off guilty
       But that he speaks.

     * Hermione. There's some ill planet reigns: 725
       I must be patient till the heavens look
       With an aspect more favourable. Good my lords,
       I am not prone to weeping, as our sex
       Commonly are; the want of which vain dew
       Perchance shall dry your pities: but I have 730
       That honourable grief lodged here which burns
       Worse than tears drown: beseech you all, my lords,
       With thoughts so qualified as your charities
       Shall best instruct you, measure me; and so
       The king's will be perform'd! 735

     * Leontes. Shall I be heard?

     * Hermione. Who is't that goes with me? Beseech your highness,
       My women may be with me; for you see
       My plight requires it. Do not weep, good fools;
       There is no cause: when you shall know your mistress 740
       Has deserved prison, then abound in tears
       As I come out: this action I now go on
       Is for my better grace. Adieu, my lord:
       I never wish'd to see you sorry; now
       I trust I shall. My women, come; you have leave. 745

     * Leontes. Go, do our bidding; hence!

   [Exit HERMIONE, guarded; with Ladies]
     * First Lord. Beseech your highness, call the queen again.

     * Antigonus. Be certain what you do, sir, lest your justice
       Prove violence; in the which three great ones suffer, 750
       Yourself, your queen, your son.

     * First Lord. For her, my lord,
       I dare my life lay down and will do't, sir,
       Please you to accept it, that the queen is spotless
       I' the eyes of heaven and to you; I mean, 755
       In this which you accuse her.

     * Antigonus. If it prove
       She's otherwise, I'll keep my stables where
       I lodge my wife; I'll go in couples with her;
       Than when I feel and see her no farther trust her; 760
       For every inch of woman in the world,
       Ay, every dram of woman's flesh is false, If she be.

     * Leontes. Hold your peaces.

     * First Lord. Good my lord,—

     * Antigonus. It is for you we speak, not for ourselves: 765
       You are abused and by some putter-on
       That will be damn'd for't; would I knew the villain,
       I would land-damn him. Be she honour-flaw'd,
       I have three daughters; the eldest is eleven
       The second and the third, nine, and some five; 770
       If this prove true, they'll pay for't:
       by mine honour,
       I'll geld 'em all; fourteen they shall not see,
       To bring false generations: they are co-heirs;
       And I had rather glib myself than they 775
       Should not produce fair issue.

     * Leontes. Cease; no more.
       You smell this business with a sense as cold
       As is a dead man's nose: but I do see't and feel't
       As you feel doing thus; and see withal 780
       The instruments that feel.

     * Antigonus. If it be so,
       We need no grave to bury honesty:
       There's not a grain of it the face to sweeten
       Of the whole dungy earth. 785

     * Leontes. What! lack I credit?

     * First Lord. I had rather you did lack than I, my lord,
       Upon this ground; and more it would content me
       To have her honour true than your suspicion,
       Be blamed for't how you might. 790

     * Leontes. Why, what need we
       Commune with you of this, but rather follow
       Our forceful instigation? Our prerogative
       Calls not your counsels, but our natural goodness
       Imparts this; which if you, or stupefied 795
       Or seeming so in skill, cannot or will not
       Relish a truth like us, inform yourselves
       We need no more of your advice: the matter,
       The loss, the gain, the ordering on't, is all
       Properly ours. 800

     * Antigonus. And I wish, my liege,
       You had only in your silent judgment tried it,
       Without more overture.

     * Leontes. How could that be?
       Either thou art most ignorant by age, 805
       Or thou wert born a fool. Camillo's flight,
       Added to their familiarity,
       Which was as gross as ever touch'd conjecture,
       That lack'd sight only, nought for approbation
       But only seeing, all other circumstances 810
       Made up to the deed, doth push on this proceeding:
       Yet, for a greater confirmation,
       For in an act of this importance 'twere
       Most piteous to be wild, I have dispatch'd in post
       To sacred Delphos, to Apollo's temple, 815
       Cleomenes and Dion, whom you know
       Of stuff'd sufficiency: now from the oracle
       They will bring all; whose spiritual counsel had,
       Shall stop or spur me. Have I done well?

     * First Lord. Well done, my lord. 820

     * Leontes. Though I am satisfied and need no more
       Than what I know, yet shall the oracle
       Give rest to the minds of others, such as he
       Whose ignorant credulity will not
       Come up to the truth. So have we thought it good 825
       From our free person she should be confined,
       Lest that the treachery of the two fled hence
       Be left her to perform. Come, follow us;
       We are to speak in public; for this business
       Will raise us all. 830

     * Antigonus. [Aside]
       To laughter, as I take it,
       If the good truth were known.

   [Exeunt]

   Act II, Scene 2

   A prison.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   [Enter PAULINA, a Gentleman, and Attendants]
     * Paulina. The keeper of the prison, call to him;
       let him have knowledge who I am.
       [Exit Gentleman]
       Good lady,
       No court in Europe is too good for thee; 840
       What dost thou then in prison?
       [Re-enter Gentleman, with the Gaoler]
       Now, good sir,
       You know me, do you not?

     * Gaoler. For a worthy lady 845
       And one whom much I honour.

     * Paulina. Pray you then,
       Conduct me to the queen.

     * Gaoler. I may not, madam:
       To the contrary I have express commandment. 850

     * Paulina. Here's ado,
       To lock up honesty and honour from
       The access of gentle visitors!
       Is't lawful, pray you,
       To see her women? any of them? Emilia? 855

     * Gaoler. So please you, madam,
       To put apart these your attendants, I
       Shall bring Emilia forth.

     * Paulina. I pray now, call her.
       Withdraw yourselves. 860

   [Exeunt Gentleman and Attendants]
     * Gaoler. And, madam,
       I must be present at your conference.

     * Paulina. Well, be't so, prithee.
       [Exit Gaoler] 865
       Here's such ado to make no stain a stain
       As passes colouring.
       [Re-enter Gaoler, with EMILIA]
       Dear gentlewoman,
       How fares our gracious lady? 870

     * Emilia. As well as one so great and so forlorn
       May hold together: on her frights and griefs,
       Which never tender lady hath born greater,
       She is something before her time deliver'd.

     * Paulina. A boy? 875

     * Emilia. A daughter, and a goodly babe,
       Lusty and like to live: the queen receives
       Much comfort in't; says 'My poor prisoner,
       I am innocent as you.'

     * Paulina. I dare be sworn 880
       These dangerous unsafe lunes i' the king,
       beshrew them!
       He must be told on't, and he shall: the office
       Becomes a woman best; I'll take't upon me:
       If I prove honey-mouth'd let my tongue blister 885
       And never to my red-look'd anger be
       The trumpet any more. Pray you, Emilia,
       Commend my best obedience to the queen:
       If she dares trust me with her little babe,
       I'll show't the king and undertake to be 890
       Her advocate to the loud'st. We do not know
       How he may soften at the sight o' the child:
       The silence often of pure innocence
       Persuades when speaking fails.

     * Emilia. Most worthy madam, 895
       Your honour and your goodness is so evident
       That your free undertaking cannot miss
       A thriving issue: there is no lady living
       So meet for this great errand. Please your ladyship
       To visit the next room, I'll presently 900
       Acquaint the queen of your most noble offer;
       Who but to-day hammer'd of this design,
       But durst not tempt a minister of honour,
       Lest she should be denied.

     * Paulina. Tell her, Emilia. 905
       I'll use that tongue I have: if wit flow from't
       As boldness from my bosom, let 't not be doubted
       I shall do good.

     * Emilia. Now be you blest for it!
       I'll to the queen: please you, 910
       come something nearer.

     * Gaoler. Madam, if't please the queen to send the babe,
       I know not what I shall incur to pass it,
       Having no warrant.

     * Paulina. You need not fear it, sir: 915
       This child was prisoner to the womb and is
       By law and process of great nature thence
       Freed and enfranchised, not a party to
       The anger of the king nor guilty of,
       If any be, the trespass of the queen. 920

     * Gaoler. I do believe it.

     * Paulina. Do not you fear: upon mine honour,
       I will stand betwixt you and danger.

   [Exeunt]

   Act II, Scene 3

   A room in LEONTES’ palace.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   [Enter LEONTES, ANTIGONUS, Lords, and Servants]
     * Leontes. Nor night nor day no rest: it is but weakness
       To bear the matter thus; mere weakness. If
       The cause were not in being,—part o' the cause,
       She the adulteress; for the harlot king
       Is quite beyond mine arm, out of the blank 930
       And level of my brain, plot-proof; but she
       I can hook to me: say that she were gone,
       Given to the fire, a moiety of my rest
       Might come to me again. Who's there?

     * First Servant. My lord? 935

     * Leontes. How does the boy?

     * First Servant. He took good rest to-night;
       'Tis hoped his sickness is discharged.

     * Leontes. To see his nobleness!
       Conceiving the dishonour of his mother, 940
       He straight declined, droop'd, took it deeply,
       Fasten'd and fix'd the shame on't in himself,
       Threw off his spirit, his appetite, his sleep,
       And downright languish'd. Leave me solely: go,
       See how he fares. 945
       [Exit Servant]
       Fie, fie! no thought of him:
       The thought of my revenges that way
       Recoil upon me: in himself too mighty,
       And in his parties, his alliance; let him be 950
       Until a time may serve: for present vengeance,
       Take it on her. Camillo and Polixenes
       Laugh at me, make their pastime at my sorrow:
       They should not laugh if I could reach them, nor
       Shall she within my power. 955

   [Enter PAULINA, with a child]
     * First Lord. You must not enter.

     * Paulina. Nay, rather, good my lords, be second to me:
       Fear you his tyrannous passion more, alas,
       Than the queen's life? a gracious innocent soul, 960
       More free than he is jealous.

     * Antigonus. That's enough.

     * Second Servant. Madam, he hath not slept tonight; commanded
       None should come at him.

     * Paulina. Not so hot, good sir: 965
       I come to bring him sleep. 'Tis such as you,
       That creep like shadows by him and do sigh
       At each his needless heavings, such as you
       Nourish the cause of his awaking: I
       Do come with words as medicinal as true, 970
       Honest as either, to purge him of that humour
       That presses him from sleep.

     * Leontes. What noise there, ho?

     * Paulina. No noise, my lord; but needful conference
       About some gossips for your highness. 975

     * Leontes. How!
       Away with that audacious lady! Antigonus,
       I charged thee that she should not come about me:
       I knew she would.

     * Antigonus. I told her so, my lord, 980
       On your displeasure's peril and on mine,
       She should not visit you.

     * Leontes. What, canst not rule her?

     * Paulina. From all dishonesty he can: in this,
       Unless he take the course that you have done, 985
       Commit me for committing honour, trust it,
       He shall not rule me.

     * Antigonus. La you now, you hear:
       When she will take the rein I let her run;
       But she'll not stumble. 990

     * Paulina. Good my liege, I come;
       And, I beseech you, hear me, who profess
       Myself your loyal servant, your physician,
       Your most obedient counsellor, yet that dare
       Less appear so in comforting your evils, 995
       Than such as most seem yours: I say, I come
       From your good queen.

     * Leontes. Good queen!

     * Paulina. Good queen, my lord,
       Good queen; I say good queen; 1000
       And would by combat make her good, so were I
       A man, the worst about you.

     * Leontes. Force her hence.

     * Paulina. Let him that makes but trifles of his eyes
       First hand me: on mine own accord I'll off; 1005
       But first I'll do my errand. The good queen,
       For she is good, hath brought you forth a daughter;
       Here 'tis; commends it to your blessing.

   [Laying down the child]
     * Leontes. Out! 1010
       A mankind witch! Hence with her, out o' door:
       A most intelligencing bawd!

     * Paulina. Not so:
       I am as ignorant in that as you
       In so entitling me, and no less honest 1015
       Than you are mad; which is enough, I'll warrant,
       As this world goes, to pass for honest.

     * Leontes. Traitors!
       Will you not push her out? Give her the bastard.
       Thou dotard! thou art woman-tired, unroosted 1020
       By thy dame Partlet here. Take up the bastard;
       Take't up, I say; give't to thy crone.

     * Paulina. For ever
       Unvenerable be thy hands, if thou
       Takest up the princess by that forced baseness 1025
       Which he has put upon't!

     * Leontes. He dreads his wife.

     * Paulina. So I would you did; then 'twere past all doubt
       You'ld call your children yours.

     * Leontes. A nest of traitors! 1030

     * Antigonus. I am none, by this good light.

     * Paulina. Nor I, nor any
       But one that's here, and that's himself, for he
       The sacred honour of himself, his queen's,
       His hopeful son's, his babe's, betrays to slander, 1035
       Whose sting is sharper than the sword's;
       and will not—
       For, as the case now stands, it is a curse
       He cannot be compell'd to't—once remove
       The root of his opinion, which is rotten 1040
       As ever oak or stone was sound.

     * Leontes. A callat
       Of boundless tongue, who late hath beat her husband
       And now baits me! This brat is none of mine;
       It is the issue of Polixenes: 1045
       Hence with it, and together with the dam
       Commit them to the fire!

     * Paulina. It is yours;
       And, might we lay the old proverb to your charge,
       So like you, 'tis the worse. Behold, my lords, 1050
       Although the print be little, the whole matter
       And copy of the father, eye, nose, lip,
       The trick of's frown, his forehead, nay, the valley,
       The pretty dimples of his chin and cheek,
       His smiles, 1055
       The very mould and frame of hand, nail, finger:
       And thou, good goddess Nature, which hast made it
       So like to him that got it, if thou hast
       The ordering of the mind too, 'mongst all colours
       No yellow in't, lest she suspect, as he does, 1060
       Her children not her husband's!

     * Leontes. A gross hag
       And, lozel, thou art worthy to be hang'd,
       That wilt not stay her tongue.

     * Antigonus. Hang all the husbands 1065
       That cannot do that feat, you'll leave yourself
       Hardly one subject.

     * Leontes. Once more, take her hence.

     * Paulina. A most unworthy and unnatural lord
       Can do no more. 1070

     * Leontes. I'll ha' thee burnt.

     * Paulina. I care not:
       It is an heretic that makes the fire,
       Not she which burns in't. I'll not call you tyrant;
       But this most cruel usage of your queen, 1075
       Not able to produce more accusation
       Than your own weak-hinged fancy, something savours
       Of tyranny and will ignoble make you,
       Yea, scandalous to the world.

     * Leontes. On your allegiance, 1080
       Out of the chamber with her! Were I a tyrant,
       Where were her life? she durst not call me so,
       If she did know me one. Away with her!

     * Paulina. I pray you, do not push me; I'll be gone.
       Look to your babe, my lord; 'tis yours: 1085
       Jove send her
       A better guiding spirit! What needs these hands?
       You, that are thus so tender o'er his follies,
       Will never do him good, not one of you.
       So, so: farewell; we are gone. 1090

   [Exit]
     * Leontes. Thou, traitor, hast set on thy wife to this.
       My child? away with't! Even thou, that hast
       A heart so tender o'er it, take it hence
       And see it instantly consumed with fire; 1095
       Even thou and none but thou. Take it up straight:
       Within this hour bring me word 'tis done,
       And by good testimony, or I'll seize thy life,
       With what thou else call'st thine. If thou refuse
       And wilt encounter with my wrath, say so; 1100
       The bastard brains with these my proper hands
       Shall I dash out. Go, take it to the fire;
       For thou set'st on thy wife.

     * Antigonus. I did not, sir:
       These lords, my noble fellows, if they please, 1105
       Can clear me in't.

     * Lords. We can: my royal liege,
       He is not guilty of her coming hither.

     * Leontes. You're liars all.

     * First Lord. Beseech your highness, give us better credit: 1110
       We have always truly served you, and beseech you
       So to esteem of us, and on our knees we beg,
       As recompense of our dear services
       Past and to come, that you do change this purpose,
       Which being so horrible, so bloody, must 1115
       Lead on to some foul issue: we all kneel.

     * Leontes. I am a feather for each wind that blows:
       Shall I live on to see this bastard kneel
       And call me father? better burn it now
       Than curse it then. But be it; let it live. 1120
       It shall not neither. You, sir, come you hither;
       You that have been so tenderly officious
       With Lady Margery, your midwife there,
       To save this bastard's life,—for 'tis a bastard,
       So sure as this beard's grey, 1125
       —what will you adventure
       To save this brat's life?

     * Antigonus. Any thing, my lord,
       That my ability may undergo
       And nobleness impose: at least thus much: 1130
       I'll pawn the little blood which I have left
       To save the innocent: any thing possible.

     * Leontes. It shall be possible. Swear by this sword
       Thou wilt perform my bidding.

     * Antigonus. I will, my lord. 1135

     * Leontes. Mark and perform it, see'st thou! for the fail
       Of any point in't shall not only be
       Death to thyself but to thy lewd-tongued wife,
       Whom for this time we pardon. We enjoin thee,
       As thou art liege-man to us, that thou carry 1140
       This female bastard hence and that thou bear it
       To some remote and desert place quite out
       Of our dominions, and that there thou leave it,
       Without more mercy, to its own protection
       And favour of the climate. As by strange fortune 1145
       It came to us, I do in justice charge thee,
       On thy soul's peril and thy body's torture,
       That thou commend it strangely to some place
       Where chance may nurse or end it. Take it up.

     * Antigonus. I swear to do this, though a present death 1150
       Had been more merciful. Come on, poor babe:
       Some powerful spirit instruct the kites and ravens
       To be thy nurses! Wolves and bears, they say
       Casting their savageness aside have done
       Like offices of pity. Sir, be prosperous 1155
       In more than this deed does require! And blessing
       Against this cruelty fight on thy side,
       Poor thing, condemn'd to loss!

   [Exit with the child]
     * Leontes. No, I'll not rear 1160
       Another's issue.

   [Enter a Servant]
     * Servant. Please your highness, posts
       From those you sent to the oracle are come
       An hour since: Cleomenes and Dion, 1165
       Being well arrived from Delphos, are both landed,
       Hasting to the court.

     * First Lord. So please you, sir, their speed
       Hath been beyond account.

     * Leontes. Twenty-three days 1170
       They have been absent: 'tis good speed; foretells
       The great Apollo suddenly will have
       The truth of this appear. Prepare you, lords;
       Summon a session, that we may arraign
       Our most disloyal lady, for, as she hath 1175
       Been publicly accused, so shall she have
       A just and open trial. While she lives
       My heart will be a burthen to me. Leave me,
       And think upon my bidding.

   [Exeunt]
   _______________________________________________________________________



   Act III, Scene 1

   A sea-port in Sicilia.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   [Enter CLEOMENES and DION]
     * Cleomenes. The climate's delicate, the air most sweet,
       Fertile the isle, the temple much surpassing
       The common praise it bears.

     * Dion. I shall report, 1185
       For most it caught me, the celestial habits,
       Methinks I so should term them, and the reverence
       Of the grave wearers. O, the sacrifice!
       How ceremonious, solemn and unearthly
       It was i' the offering! 1190

     * Cleomenes. But of all, the burst
       And the ear-deafening voice o' the oracle,
       Kin to Jove's thunder, so surprised my sense.
       That I was nothing.

     * Dion. If the event o' the journey 1195
       Prove as successful to the queen,—O be't so!—
       As it hath been to us rare, pleasant, speedy,
       The time is worth the use on't.

     * Cleomenes. Great Apollo
       Turn all to the best! These proclamations, 1200
       So forcing faults upon Hermione,
       I little like.

     * Dion. The violent carriage of it
       Will clear or end the business: when the oracle,
       Thus by Apollo's great divine seal'd up, 1205
       Shall the contents discover, something rare
       Even then will rush to knowledge. Go: fresh horses!
       And gracious be the issue!

   [Exeunt]
   _______________________________________________________________________



   Act III, Scene 2

   A court of Justice.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   [Enter LEONTES, Lords, and Officers]
     * Leontes. This sessions, to our great grief we pronounce,
       Even pushes 'gainst our heart: the party tried
       The daughter of a king, our wife, and one
       Of us too much beloved. Let us be clear'd
       Of being tyrannous, since we so openly 1215
       Proceed in justice, which shall have due course,
       Even to the guilt or the purgation.
       Produce the prisoner.

     * Officer. It is his highness' pleasure that the queen
       Appear in person here in court. Silence! 1220
       [Enter HERMIONE guarded;]
       PAULINA and Ladies attending]

     * Leontes. Read the indictment.

     * Officer. [Reads] Hermione, queen to the worthy
       Leontes, king of Sicilia, thou art here accused and 1225
       arraigned of high treason, in committing adultery
       with Polixenes, king of Bohemia, and conspiring
       with Camillo to take away the life of our sovereign
       lord the king, thy royal husband: the pretence
       whereof being by circumstances partly laid open, 1230
       thou, Hermione, contrary to the faith and allegiance
       of a true subject, didst counsel and aid them, for
       their better safety, to fly away by night.

     * Hermione. Since what I am to say must be but that
       Which contradicts my accusation and 1235
       The testimony on my part no other
       But what comes from myself, it shall scarce boot me
       To say 'not guilty:' mine integrity
       Being counted falsehood, shall, as I express it,
       Be so received. But thus: if powers divine 1240
       Behold our human actions, as they do,
       I doubt not then but innocence shall make
       False accusation blush and tyranny
       Tremble at patience. You, my lord, best know,
       Who least will seem to do so, my past life 1245
       Hath been as continent, as chaste, as true,
       As I am now unhappy; which is more
       Than history can pattern, though devised
       And play'd to take spectators. For behold me
       A fellow of the royal bed, which owe 1250
       A moiety of the throne a great king's daughter,
       The mother to a hopeful prince, here standing
       To prate and talk for life and honour 'fore
       Who please to come and hear. For life, I prize it
       As I weigh grief, which I would spare: for honour, 1255
       'Tis a derivative from me to mine,
       And only that I stand for. I appeal
       To your own conscience, sir, before Polixenes
       Came to your court, how I was in your grace,
       How merited to be so; since he came, 1260
       With what encounter so uncurrent I
       Have strain'd to appear thus: if one jot beyond
       The bound of honour, or in act or will
       That way inclining, harden'd be the hearts
       Of all that hear me, and my near'st of kin 1265
       Cry fie upon my grave!

     * Leontes. I ne'er heard yet
       That any of these bolder vices wanted
       Less impudence to gainsay what they did
       Than to perform it first. 1270

     * Hermione. That's true enough;
       Through 'tis a saying, sir, not due to me.

     * Leontes. You will not own it.

     * Hermione. More than mistress of
       Which comes to me in name of fault, I must not 1275
       At all acknowledge. For Polixenes,
       With whom I am accused, I do confess
       I loved him as in honour he required,
       With such a kind of love as might become
       A lady like me, with a love even such, 1280
       So and no other, as yourself commanded:
       Which not to have done I think had been in me
       Both disobedience and ingratitude
       To you and toward your friend, whose love had spoke,
       Even since it could speak, from an infant, freely 1285
       That it was yours. Now, for conspiracy,
       I know not how it tastes; though it be dish'd
       For me to try how: all I know of it
       Is that Camillo was an honest man;
       And why he left your court, the gods themselves, 1290
       Wotting no more than I, are ignorant.

     * Leontes. You knew of his departure, as you know
       What you have underta'en to do in's absence.

     * Hermione. Sir,
       You speak a language that I understand not: 1295
       My life stands in the level of your dreams,
       Which I'll lay down.

     * Leontes. Your actions are my dreams;
       You had a bastard by Polixenes,
       And I but dream'd it. As you were past all shame,— 1300
       Those of your fact are so—so past all truth:
       Which to deny concerns more than avails; for as
       Thy brat hath been cast out, like to itself,
       No father owning it,—which is, indeed,
       More criminal in thee than it,—so thou 1305
       Shalt feel our justice, in whose easiest passage
       Look for no less than death.

     * Hermione. Sir, spare your threats:
       The bug which you would fright me with I seek.
       To me can life be no commodity: 1310
       The crown and comfort of my life, your favour,
       I do give lost; for I do feel it gone,
       But know not how it went. My second joy
       And first-fruits of my body, from his presence
       I am barr'd, like one infectious. My third comfort 1315
       Starr'd most unluckily, is from my breast,
       The innocent milk in its most innocent mouth,
       Haled out to murder: myself on every post
       Proclaimed a strumpet: with immodest hatred
       The child-bed privilege denied, which 'longs 1320
       To women of all fashion; lastly, hurried
       Here to this place, i' the open air, before
       I have got strength of limit. Now, my liege,
       Tell me what blessings I have here alive,
       That I should fear to die? Therefore proceed. 1325
       But yet hear this: mistake me not; no life,
       I prize it not a straw, but for mine honour,
       Which I would free, if I shall be condemn'd
       Upon surmises, all proofs sleeping else
       But what your jealousies awake, I tell you 1330
       'Tis rigor and not law. Your honours all,
       I do refer me to the oracle:
       Apollo be my judge!

     * First Lord. This your request
       Is altogether just: therefore bring forth, 1335
       And in Apollos name, his oracle.

   [Exeunt certain Officers]
     * Hermione. The Emperor of Russia was my father:
       O that he were alive, and here beholding
       His daughter's trial! that he did but see 1340
       The flatness of my misery, yet with eyes
       Of pity, not revenge!

   [Re-enter Officers, with CLEOMENES and DION]
     * Officer. You here shall swear upon this sword of justice,
       That you, Cleomenes and Dion, have 1345
       Been both at Delphos, and from thence have brought
       The seal'd-up oracle, by the hand deliver'd
       Of great Apollo's priest; and that, since then,
       You have not dared to break the holy seal
       Nor read the secrets in't. 1350

     * Cleomenes. [with Dion] All this we swear.

     * Leontes. Break up the seals and read.

     * Officer. [Reads]. Hermione is chaste;
       Polixenes blameless; Camillo a true subject; Leontes
       a jealous tyrant; his innocent babe truly begotten; 1355
       and the king shall live without an heir, if that
       which is lost be not found.

     * Lords. Now blessed be the great Apollo!

     * Hermione. Praised!

     * Leontes. Hast thou read truth? 1360

     * Officer. Ay, my lord; even so
       As it is here set down.

     * Leontes. There is no truth at all i' the oracle:
       The sessions shall proceed: this is mere falsehood.

   [Enter Servant]
     * Servant. My lord the king, the king!

     * Leontes. What is the business?

     * Servant. O sir, I shall be hated to report it!
       The prince your son, with mere conceit and fear
       Of the queen's speed, is gone. 1370

     * Leontes. How! gone!

     * Servant. Is dead.

     * Leontes. Apollo's angry; and the heavens themselves
       Do strike at my injustice.
       [HERMIONE swoons] 1375
       How now there!

     * Paulina. This news is mortal to the queen: look down
       And see what death is doing.

     * Leontes. Take her hence:
       Her heart is but o'ercharged; she will recover: 1380
       I have too much believed mine own suspicion:
       Beseech you, tenderly apply to her
       Some remedies for life.
       [Exeunt PAULINA and Ladies, with HERMIONE]
       Apollo, pardon 1385
       My great profaneness 'gainst thine oracle!
       I'll reconcile me to Polixenes,
       New woo my queen, recall the good Camillo,
       Whom I proclaim a man of truth, of mercy;
       For, being transported by my jealousies 1390
       To bloody thoughts and to revenge, I chose
       Camillo for the minister to poison
       My friend Polixenes: which had been done,
       But that the good mind of Camillo tardied
       My swift command, though I with death and with 1395
       Reward did threaten and encourage him,
       Not doing 't and being done: he, most humane
       And fill'd with honour, to my kingly guest
       Unclasp'd my practise, quit his fortunes here,
       Which you knew great, and to the hazard 1400
       Of all encertainties himself commended,
       No richer than his honour: how he glisters
       Thorough my rust! and how his pity
       Does my deeds make the blacker!

   [Re-enter PAULINA]
     * Paulina. Woe the while!
       O, cut my lace, lest my heart, cracking it,
       Break too.

     * First Lord. What fit is this, good lady?

     * Paulina. What studied torments, tyrant, hast for me? 1410
       What wheels? racks? fires? what flaying? boiling?
       In leads or oils? what old or newer torture
       Must I receive, whose every word deserves
       To taste of thy most worst? Thy tyranny
       Together working with thy jealousies, 1415
       Fancies too weak for boys, too green and idle
       For girls of nine, O, think what they have done
       And then run mad indeed, stark mad! for all
       Thy by-gone fooleries were but spices of it.
       That thou betray'dst Polixenes,'twas nothing; 1420
       That did but show thee, of a fool, inconstant
       And damnable ingrateful: nor was't much,
       Thou wouldst have poison'd good Camillo's honour,
       To have him kill a king: poor trespasses,
       More monstrous standing by: whereof I reckon 1425
       The casting forth to crows thy baby-daughter
       To be or none or little; though a devil
       Would have shed water out of fire ere done't:
       Nor is't directly laid to thee, the death
       Of the young prince, whose honourable thoughts, 1430
       Thoughts high for one so tender, cleft the heart
       That could conceive a gross and foolish sire
       Blemish'd his gracious dam: this is not, no,
       Laid to thy answer: but the last,—O lords,
       When I have said, cry 'woe!' the queen, the queen, 1435
       The sweet'st, dear'st creature's dead,
       and vengeance for't
       Not dropp'd down yet.

     * First Lord. The higher powers forbid!

     * Paulina. I say she's dead; I'll swear't. If word nor oath 1440
       Prevail not, go and see: if you can bring
       Tincture or lustre in her lip, her eye,
       Heat outwardly or breath within, I'll serve you
       As I would do the gods. But, O thou tyrant!
       Do not repent these things, for they are heavier 1445
       Than all thy woes can stir; therefore betake thee
       To nothing but despair. A thousand knees
       Ten thousand years together, naked, fasting,
       Upon a barren mountain and still winter
       In storm perpetual, could not move the gods 1450
       To look that way thou wert.

     * Leontes. Go on, go on
       Thou canst not speak too much; I have deserved
       All tongues to talk their bitterest.

     * First Lord. Say no more: 1455
       Howe'er the business goes, you have made fault
       I' the boldness of your speech.

     * Paulina. I am sorry for't:
       All faults I make, when I shall come to know them,
       I do repent. Alas! I have show'd too much 1460
       The rashness of a woman: he is touch'd
       To the noble heart. What's gone and what's past help
       Should be past grief: do not receive affliction
       At my petition; I beseech you, rather
       Let me be punish'd, that have minded you 1465
       Of what you should forget. Now, good my liege
       Sir, royal sir, forgive a foolish woman:
       The love I bore your queen—lo, fool again!—
       I'll speak of her no more, nor of your children;
       I'll not remember you of my own lord, 1470
       Who is lost too: take your patience to you,
       And I'll say nothing.

     * Leontes. Thou didst speak but well
       When most the truth; which I receive much better
       Than to be pitied of thee. Prithee, bring me 1475
       To the dead bodies of my queen and son:
       One grave shall be for both: upon them shall
       The causes of their death appear, unto
       Our shame perpetual. Once a day I'll visit
       The chapel where they lie, and tears shed there 1480
       Shall be my recreation: so long as nature
       Will bear up with this exercise, so long
       I daily vow to use it. Come and lead me
       Unto these sorrows.

   [Exeunt]

   Act III, Scene 3

   Bohemia. A desert country near the sea.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   [Enter ANTIGONUS with a Child, and a Mariner]
     * Antigonus. Thou art perfect then, our ship hath touch'd upon
       The deserts of Bohemia?

     * Mariner. Ay, my lord: and fear
       We have landed in ill time: the skies look grimly 1490
       And threaten present blusters. In my conscience,
       The heavens with that we have in hand are angry
       And frown upon 's.

     * Antigonus. Their sacred wills be done! Go, get aboard;
       Look to thy bark: I'll not be long before 1495
       I call upon thee.

     * Mariner. Make your best haste, and go not
       Too far i' the land: 'tis like to be loud weather;
       Besides, this place is famous for the creatures
       Of prey that keep upon't. 1500

     * Antigonus. Go thou away:
       I'll follow instantly.

     * Mariner. I am glad at heart
       To be so rid o' the business.

   [Exit]
     * Antigonus. Come, poor babe:
       I have heard, but not believed,
       the spirits o' the dead
       May walk again: if such thing be, thy mother
       Appear'd to me last night, for ne'er was dream 1510
       So like a waking. To me comes a creature,
       Sometimes her head on one side, some another;
       I never saw a vessel of like sorrow,
       So fill'd and so becoming: in pure white robes,
       Like very sanctity, she did approach 1515
       My cabin where I lay; thrice bow'd before me,
       And gasping to begin some speech, her eyes
       Became two spouts: the fury spent, anon
       Did this break-from her: 'Good Antigonus,
       Since fate, against thy better disposition, 1520
       Hath made thy person for the thrower-out
       Of my poor babe, according to thine oath,
       Places remote enough are in Bohemia,
       There weep and leave it crying; and, for the babe
       Is counted lost for ever, Perdita, 1525
       I prithee, call't. For this ungentle business
       Put on thee by my lord, thou ne'er shalt see
       Thy wife Paulina more.' And so, with shrieks
       She melted into air. Affrighted much,
       I did in time collect myself and thought 1530
       This was so and no slumber. Dreams are toys:
       Yet for this once, yea, superstitiously,
       I will be squared by this. I do believe
       Hermione hath suffer'd death, and that
       Apollo would, this being indeed the issue 1535
       Of King Polixenes, it should here be laid,
       Either for life or death, upon the earth
       Of its right father. Blossom, speed thee well!
       There lie, and there thy character: there these;
       Which may, if fortune please, both breed thee, pretty, 1540
       And still rest thine. The storm begins; poor wretch,
       That for thy mother's fault art thus exposed
       To loss and what may follow! Weep I cannot,
       But my heart bleeds; and most accursed am I
       To be by oath enjoin'd to this. Farewell! 1545
       The day frowns more and more: thou'rt like to have
       A lullaby too rough: I never saw
       The heavens so dim by day. A savage clamour!
       Well may I get aboard! This is the chase:
       I am gone for ever. 1550

   [Exit, pursued by a bear]

   [Enter a Shepherd]
     * Old Shepherd. I would there were no age between sixteen and
       three-and-twenty, or that youth would sleep out the
       rest; for there is nothing in the between but 1555
       getting wenches with child, wronging the ancientry,
       stealing, fighting—Hark you now! Would any but
       these boiled brains of nineteen and two-and-twenty
       hunt this weather? They have scared away two of my
       best sheep, which I fear the wolf will sooner find 1560
       than the master: if any where I have them, 'tis by
       the seaside, browsing of ivy. Good luck, an't be thy
       will what have we here! Mercy on 's, a barne a very
       pretty barne! A boy or a child, I wonder? A
       pretty one; a very pretty one: sure, some 'scape: 1565
       though I am not bookish, yet I can read
       waiting-gentlewoman in the 'scape. This has been
       some stair-work, some trunk-work, some
       behind-door-work: they were warmer that got this
       than the poor thing is here. I'll take it up for 1570
       pity: yet I'll tarry till my son come; he hallooed
       but even now. Whoa, ho, hoa!

   [Enter Clown]
     * Clown. Hilloa, loa!

     * Old Shepherd. What, art so near? If thou'lt see a thing to talk
       1575
       on when thou art dead and rotten, come hither. What
       ailest thou, man?

     * Clown. I have seen two such sights, by sea and by land!
       but I am not to say it is a sea, for it is now the
       sky: betwixt the firmament and it you cannot thrust 1580
       a bodkin's point.

     * Old Shepherd. Why, boy, how is it?

     * Clown. I would you did but see how it chafes, how it rages,
       how it takes up the shore! but that's not the
       point. O, the most piteous cry of the poor souls! 1585
       sometimes to see 'em, and not to see 'em; now the
       ship boring the moon with her main-mast, and anon
       swallowed with yest and froth, as you'ld thrust a
       cork into a hogshead. And then for the
       land-service, to see how the bear tore out his 1590
       shoulder-bone; how he cried to me for help and said
       his name was Antigonus, a nobleman. But to make an
       end of the ship, to see how the sea flap-dragoned
       it: but, first, how the poor souls roared, and the
       sea mocked them; and how the poor gentleman roared 1595
       and the bear mocked him, both roaring louder than
       the sea or weather.

     * Old Shepherd. Name of mercy, when was this, boy?

     * Clown. Now, now: I have not winked since I saw these
       sights: the men are not yet cold under water, nor 1600
       the bear half dined on the gentleman: he's at it
       now.

     * Old Shepherd. Would I had been by, to have helped the old man!

     * Clown. I would you had been by the ship side, to have
       helped her: there your charity would have lacked footing. 1605

     * Old Shepherd. Heavy matters! heavy matters! but look thee here,
       boy. Now bless thyself: thou mettest with things
       dying, I with things newborn. Here's a sight for
       thee; look thee, a bearing-cloth for a squire's
       child! look thee here; take up, take up, boy; 1610
       open't. So, let's see: it was told me I should be
       rich by the fairies. This is some changeling:
       open't. What's within, boy?

     * Clown. You're a made old man: if the sins of your youth
       are forgiven you, you're well to live. Gold! all gold! 1615

     * Old Shepherd. This is fairy gold, boy, and 'twill prove so: up
       with't, keep it close: home, home, the next way.
       We are lucky, boy; and to be so still requires
       nothing but secrecy. Let my sheep go: come, good
       boy, the next way home. 1620

     * Clown. Go you the next way with your findings. I'll go see
       if the bear be gone from the gentleman and how much
       he hath eaten: they are never curst but when they
       are hungry: if there be any of him left, I'll bury
       it. 1625

     * Old Shepherd. That's a good deed. If thou mayest discern by that
       which is left of him what he is, fetch me to the
       sight of him.

     * Clown. Marry, will I; and you shall help to put him i' the ground.

     * Old Shepherd. 'Tis a lucky day, boy, and we'll do good deeds on't.
       1630

   [Exeunt]

   Act IV, Scene 1

   Chorus as Time speaks.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   [Enter Time, the Chorus]
     * Time. I, that please some, try all, both joy and terror
       Of good and bad, that makes and unfolds error,
       Now take upon me, in the name of Time, 1635
       To use my wings. Impute it not a crime
       To me or my swift passage, that I slide
       O'er sixteen years and leave the growth untried
       Of that wide gap, since it is in my power
       To o'erthrow law and in one self-born hour 1640
       To plant and o'erwhelm custom. Let me pass
       The same I am, ere ancient'st order was
       Or what is now received: I witness to
       The times that brought them in; so shall I do
       To the freshest things now reigning and make stale 1645
       The glistering of this present, as my tale
       Now seems to it. Your patience this allowing,
       I turn my glass and give my scene such growing
       As you had slept between: Leontes leaving,
       The effects of his fond jealousies so grieving 1650
       That he shuts up himself, imagine me,
       Gentle spectators, that I now may be
       In fair Bohemia, and remember well,
       I mentioned a son o' the king's, which Florizel
       I now name to you; and with speed so pace 1655
       To speak of Perdita, now grown in grace
       Equal with wondering: what of her ensues
       I list not prophecy; but let Time's news
       Be known when 'tis brought forth.
       A shepherd's daughter, 1660
       And what to her adheres, which follows after,
       Is the argument of Time. Of this allow,
       If ever you have spent time worse ere now;
       If never, yet that Time himself doth say
       He wishes earnestly you never may. 1665

   Act IV, Scene 2

   Bohemia. The palace of POLIXENES.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   [Enter POLIXENES and CAMILLO]
     * Polixenes. I pray thee, good Camillo, be no more importunate:
       'tis a sickness denying thee any thing; a death to
       grant this. 1670

     * Camillo. It is fifteen years since I saw my country: though
       I have for the most part been aired abroad, I
       desire to lay my bones there. Besides, the penitent
       king, my master, hath sent for me; to whose feeling
       sorrows I might be some allay, or I o'erween to 1675
       think so, which is another spur to my departure.

     * Polixenes. As thou lovest me, Camillo, wipe not out the rest of
       thy services by leaving me now: the need I have of
       thee thine own goodness hath made; better not to
       have had thee than thus to want thee: thou, having 1680
       made me businesses which none without thee can
       sufficiently manage, must either stay to execute
       them thyself or take away with thee the very
       services thou hast done; which if I have not enough
       considered, as too much I cannot, to be more 1685
       thankful to thee shall be my study, and my profit
       therein the heaping friendships. Of that fatal
       country, Sicilia, prithee speak no more; whose very
       naming punishes me with the remembrance of that
       penitent, as thou callest him, and reconciled king, 1690
       my brother; whose loss of his most precious queen
       and children are even now to be afresh lamented.
       Say to me, when sawest thou the Prince Florizel, my
       son? Kings are no less unhappy, their issue not
       being gracious, than they are in losing them when 1695
       they have approved their virtues.

     * Camillo. Sir, it is three days since I saw the prince. What
       his happier affairs may be, are to me unknown: but I
       have missingly noted, he is of late much retired
       from court and is less frequent to his princely 1700
       exercises than formerly he hath appeared.

     * Polixenes. I have considered so much, Camillo, and with some
       care; so far that I have eyes under my service which
       look upon his removedness; from whom I have this
       intelligence, that he is seldom from the house of a 1705
       most homely shepherd; a man, they say, that from
       very nothing, and beyond the imagination of his
       neighbours, is grown into an unspeakable estate.

     * Camillo. I have heard, sir, of such a man, who hath a
       daughter of most rare note: the report of her is 1710
       extended more than can be thought to begin from such a cottage.

     * Polixenes. That's likewise part of my intelligence; but, I
       fear, the angle that plucks our son thither. Thou
       shalt accompany us to the place; where we will, not
       appearing what we are, have some question with the 1715
       shepherd; from whose simplicity I think it not
       uneasy to get the cause of my son's resort thither.
       Prithee, be my present partner in this business, and
       lay aside the thoughts of Sicilia.

     * Camillo. I willingly obey your command. 1720

     * Polixenes. My best Camillo! We must disguise ourselves.

   [Exeunt]

   Act IV, Scene 3

   A road near the Shepherd’s cottage.

   [Enter AUTOLYCUS, singing]
     * Autolycus. When daffodils begin to peer,
       With heigh! the doxy over the dale, 1725
       Why, then comes in the sweet o' the year;
       For the red blood reigns in the winter's pale.
       The white sheet bleaching on the hedge,
       With heigh! the sweet birds, O, how they sing!
       Doth set my pugging tooth on edge; 1730
       For a quart of ale is a dish for a king.
       The lark, that tirra-lyra chants,
       With heigh! with heigh! the thrush and the jay,
       Are summer songs for me and my aunts,
       While we lie tumbling in the hay. 1735
       I have served Prince Florizel and in my time
       wore three-pile; but now I am out of service:
       But shall I go mourn for that, my dear?
       The pale moon shines by night:
       And when I wander here and there, 1740
       I then do most go right.
       If tinkers may have leave to live,
       And bear the sow-skin budget,
       Then my account I well may, give,
       And in the stocks avouch it. 1745
       My traffic is sheets; when the kite builds, look to
       lesser linen. My father named me Autolycus; who
       being, as I am, littered under Mercury, was likewise
       a snapper-up of unconsidered trifles. With die and
       drab I purchased this caparison, and my revenue is 1750
       the silly cheat. Gallows and knock are too powerful
       on the highway: beating and hanging are terrors to
       me: for the life to come, I sleep out the thought
       of it. A prize! a prize!

   [Enter Clown]
     * Clown. Let me see: every 'leven wether tods; every tod
       yields pound and odd shilling; fifteen hundred
       shorn. what comes the wool to?

     * Autolycus. [Aside]
       If the springe hold, the cock's mine. 1760

     * Clown. I cannot do't without counters. Let me see; what am
       I to buy for our sheep-shearing feast? Three pound
       of sugar, five pound of currants, rice,—what will
       this sister of mine do with rice? But my father
       hath made her mistress of the feast, and she lays it 1765
       on. She hath made me four and twenty nose-gays for
       the shearers, three-man-song-men all, and very good
       ones; but they are most of them means and bases; but
       one puritan amongst them, and he sings psalms to
       horn-pipes. I must have saffron to colour the warden 1770
       pies; mace; dates?—none, that's out of my note;
       nutmegs, seven; a race or two of ginger, but that I
       may beg; four pound of prunes, and as many of
       raisins o' the sun.

     * Autolycus. O that ever I was born! 1775

   [Grovelling on the ground]
     * Clown. I' the name of me—

     * Autolycus. O, help me, help me! pluck but off these rags; and
       then, death, death!

     * Clown. Alack, poor soul! thou hast need of more rags to lay 1780
       on thee, rather than have these off.

     * Autolycus. O sir, the loathsomeness of them offends me more
       than the stripes I have received, which are mighty
       ones and millions.

     * Clown. Alas, poor man! a million of beating may come to a 1785
       great matter.

     * Autolycus. I am robbed, sir, and beaten; my money and apparel
       ta'en from me, and these detestable things put upon
       me.

     * Clown. What, by a horseman, or a footman? 1790

     * Autolycus. A footman, sweet sir, a footman.

     * Clown. Indeed, he should be a footman by the garments he
       has left with thee: if this be a horseman's coat,
       it hath seen very hot service. Lend me thy hand,
       I'll help thee: come, lend me thy hand. 1795

     * Autolycus. O, good sir, tenderly, O!

     * Clown. Alas, poor soul!

     * Autolycus. O, good sir, softly, good sir! I fear, sir, my
       shoulder-blade is out.

     * Clown. How now! canst stand? 1800

     * Autolycus. [Picking his pocket]
       Softly, dear sir; good sir, softly. You ha' done me
       a charitable office.

     * Clown. Dost lack any money? I have a little money for thee.

     * Autolycus. No, good sweet sir; no, I beseech you, sir: I have 1805
       a kinsman not past three quarters of a mile hence,
       unto whom I was going; I shall there have money, or
       any thing I want: offer me no money, I pray you;
       that kills my heart.

     * Clown. What manner of fellow was he that robbed you? 1810

     * Autolycus. A fellow, sir, that I have known to go about with
       troll-my-dames; I knew him once a servant of the
       prince: I cannot tell, good sir, for which of his
       virtues it was, but he was certainly whipped out of the court.

     * Clown. His vices, you would say; there's no virtue whipped 1815
       out of the court: they cherish it to make it stay
       there; and yet it will no more but abide.

     * Autolycus. Vices, I would say, sir. I know this man well: he
       hath been since an ape-bearer; then a
       process-server, a bailiff; then he compassed a 1820
       motion of the Prodigal Son, and married a tinker's
       wife within a mile where my land and living lies;
       and, having flown over many knavish professions, he
       settled only in rogue: some call him Autolycus.

     * Clown. Out upon him! prig, for my life, prig: he haunts 1825
       wakes, fairs and bear-baitings.

     * Autolycus. Very true, sir; he, sir, he; that's the rogue that
       put me into this apparel.

     * Clown. Not a more cowardly rogue in all Bohemia: if you had
       but looked big and spit at him, he'ld have run. 1830

     * Autolycus. I must confess to you, sir, I am no fighter: I am
       false of heart that way; and that he knew, I warrant
       him.

     * Clown. How do you now?

     * Autolycus. Sweet sir, much better than I was; I can stand and 1835
       walk: I will even take my leave of you, and pace
       softly towards my kinsman's.

     * Clown. Shall I bring thee on the way?

     * Autolycus. No, good-faced sir; no, sweet sir.

     * Clown. Then fare thee well: I must go buy spices for our 1840
       sheep-shearing.

     * Autolycus. Prosper you, sweet sir!
       [Exit Clown]
       Your purse is not hot enough to purchase your spice.
       I'll be with you at your sheep-shearing too: if I 1845
       make not this cheat bring out another and the
       shearers prove sheep, let me be unrolled and my name
       put in the book of virtue!
       [Sings]
       Jog on, jog on, the foot-path way, 1850
       And merrily hent the stile-a:
       A merry heart goes all the day,
       Your sad tires in a mile-a.

   [Exit]

   Act IV, Scene 4

   The Shepherd’s cottage.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   [Enter FLORIZEL and PERDITA]
     * Florizel. These your unusual weeds to each part of you
       Do give a life: no shepherdess, but Flora
       Peering in April's front. This your sheep-shearing
       Is as a meeting of the petty gods,
       And you the queen on't. 1860

     * Perdita. Sir, my gracious lord,
       To chide at your extremes it not becomes me:
       O, pardon, that I name them! Your high self,
       The gracious mark o' the land, you have obscured
       With a swain's wearing, and me, poor lowly maid, 1865
       Most goddess-like prank'd up: but that our feasts
       In every mess have folly and the feeders
       Digest it with a custom, I should blush
       To see you so attired, sworn, I think,
       To show myself a glass. 1870

     * Florizel. I bless the time
       When my good falcon made her flight across
       Thy father's ground.

     * Perdita. Now Jove afford you cause!
       To me the difference forges dread; your greatness 1875
       Hath not been used to fear. Even now I tremble
       To think your father, by some accident,
       Should pass this way as you did: O, the Fates!
       How would he look, to see his work so noble
       Vilely bound up? What would he say? Or how 1880
       Should I, in these my borrow'd flaunts, behold
       The sternness of his presence?

     * Florizel. Apprehend
       Nothing but jollity. The gods themselves,
       Humbling their deities to love, have taken 1885
       The shapes of beasts upon them: Jupiter
       Became a bull, and bellow'd; the green Neptune
       A ram, and bleated; and the fire-robed god,
       Golden Apollo, a poor humble swain,
       As I seem now. Their transformations 1890
       Were never for a piece of beauty rarer,
       Nor in a way so chaste, since my desires
       Run not before mine honour, nor my lusts
       Burn hotter than my faith.

     * Perdita. O, but, sir, 1895
       Your resolution cannot hold, when 'tis
       Opposed, as it must be, by the power of the king:
       One of these two must be necessities,
       Which then will speak, that you must
       change this purpose, 1900
       Or I my life.

     * Florizel. Thou dearest Perdita,
       With these forced thoughts, I prithee, darken not
       The mirth o' the feast. Or I'll be thine, my fair,
       Or not my father's. For I cannot be 1905
       Mine own, nor any thing to any, if
       I be not thine. To this I am most constant,
       Though destiny say no. Be merry, gentle;
       Strangle such thoughts as these with any thing
       That you behold the while. Your guests are coming: 1910
       Lift up your countenance, as it were the day
       Of celebration of that nuptial which
       We two have sworn shall come.

     * Perdita. O lady Fortune,
       Stand you auspicious! 1915

     * Florizel. See, your guests approach:
       Address yourself to entertain them sprightly,
       And let's be red with mirth.
       [Enter Shepherd, Clown, MOPSA, DORCAS, and]
       others, with POLIXENES and CAMILLO disguised] 1920

     * Old Shepherd. Fie, daughter! when my old wife lived, upon
       This day she was both pantler, butler, cook,
       Both dame and servant; welcomed all, served all;
       Would sing her song and dance her turn; now here,
       At upper end o' the table, now i' the middle; 1925
       On his shoulder, and his; her face o' fire
       With labour and the thing she took to quench it,
       She would to each one sip. You are retired,
       As if you were a feasted one and not
       The hostess of the meeting: pray you, bid 1930
       These unknown friends to's welcome; for it is
       A way to make us better friends, more known.
       Come, quench your blushes and present yourself
       That which you are, mistress o' the feast: come on,
       And bid us welcome to your sheep-shearing, 1935
       As your good flock shall prosper.

     * Perdita. [To POLIXENES] Sir, welcome:
       It is my father's will I should take on me
       The hostess-ship o' the day.
       [To CAMILLO] 1940
       You're welcome, sir.
       Give me those flowers there, Dorcas. Reverend sirs,
       For you there's rosemary and rue; these keep
       Seeming and savour all the winter long:
       Grace and remembrance be to you both, 1945
       And welcome to our shearing!

     * Polixenes. Shepherdess,
       A fair one are you—well you fit our ages
       With flowers of winter.

     * Perdita. Sir, the year growing ancient, 1950
       Not yet on summer's death, nor on the birth
       Of trembling winter, the fairest
       flowers o' the season
       Are our carnations and streak'd gillyvors,
       Which some call nature's bastards: of that kind 1955
       Our rustic garden's barren; and I care not
       To get slips of them.

     * Polixenes. Wherefore, gentle maiden,
       Do you neglect them?

     * Perdita. For I have heard it said 1960
       There is an art which in their piedness shares
       With great creating nature.

     * Polixenes. Say there be;
       Yet nature is made better by no mean
       But nature makes that mean: so, over that art 1965
       Which you say adds to nature, is an art
       That nature makes. You see, sweet maid, we marry
       A gentler scion to the wildest stock,
       And make conceive a bark of baser kind
       By bud of nobler race: this is an art 1970
       Which does mend nature, change it rather, but
       The art itself is nature.

     * Perdita. So it is.

     * Polixenes. Then make your garden rich in gillyvors,
       And do not call them bastards. 1975

     * Perdita. I'll not put
       The dibble in earth to set one slip of them;
       No more than were I painted I would wish
       This youth should say 'twere well and only therefore
       Desire to breed by me. Here's flowers for you; 1980
       Hot lavender, mints, savoury, marjoram;
       The marigold, that goes to bed wi' the sun
       And with him rises weeping: these are flowers
       Of middle summer, and I think they are given
       To men of middle age. You're very welcome. 1985

     * Camillo. I should leave grazing, were I of your flock,
       And only live by gazing.

     * Perdita. Out, alas!
       You'd be so lean, that blasts of January
       Would blow you through and through. 1990
       Now, my fair'st friend,
       I would I had some flowers o' the spring that might
       Become your time of day; and yours, and yours,
       That wear upon your virgin branches yet
       Your maidenheads growing: O Proserpina, 1995
       For the flowers now, that frighted thou let'st fall
       From Dis's waggon! daffodils,
       That come before the swallow dares, and take
       The winds of March with beauty; violets dim,
       But sweeter than the lids of Juno's eyes 2000
       Or Cytherea's breath; pale primroses
       That die unmarried, ere they can behold
       Bight Phoebus in his strength—a malady
       Most incident to maids; bold oxlips and
       The crown imperial; lilies of all kinds, 2005
       The flower-de-luce being one! O, these I lack,
       To make you garlands of, and my sweet friend,
       To strew him o'er and o'er!

     * Florizel. What, like a corse?

     * Perdita. No, like a bank for love to lie and play on; 2010
       Not like a corse; or if, not to be buried,
       But quick and in mine arms. Come, take your flowers:
       Methinks I play as I have seen them do
       In Whitsun pastorals: sure this robe of mine
       Does change my disposition. 2015

     * Florizel. What you do
       Still betters what is done. When you speak, sweet.
       I'ld have you do it ever: when you sing,
       I'ld have you buy and sell so, so give alms,
       Pray so; and, for the ordering your affairs, 2020
       To sing them too: when you do dance, I wish you
       A wave o' the sea, that you might ever do
       Nothing but that; move still, still so,
       And own no other function: each your doing,
       So singular in each particular, 2025
       Crowns what you are doing in the present deed,
       That all your acts are queens.

     * Perdita. O Doricles,
       Your praises are too large: but that your youth,
       And the true blood which peepeth fairly through't, 2030
       Do plainly give you out an unstain'd shepherd,
       With wisdom I might fear, my Doricles,
       You woo'd me the false way.

     * Florizel. I think you have
       As little skill to fear as I have purpose 2035
       To put you to't. But come; our dance, I pray:
       Your hand, my Perdita: so turtles pair,
       That never mean to part.

     * Perdita. I'll swear for 'em.

     * Polixenes. This is the prettiest low-born lass that ever 2040
       Ran on the green-sward: nothing she does or seems
       But smacks of something greater than herself,
       Too noble for this place.

     * Camillo. He tells her something
       That makes her blood look out: good sooth, she is 2045
       The queen of curds and cream.

     * Clown. Come on, strike up!

     * Dorcas. Mopsa must be your mistress: marry, garlic,
       To mend her kissing with!

     * Mopsa. Now, in good time! 2050

     * Clown. Not a word, a word; we stand upon our manners.
       Come, strike up!
       [Music. Here a dance of Shepherds and]
       Shepherdesses]

     * Polixenes. Pray, good shepherd, what fair swain is this 2055
       Which dances with your daughter?

     * Old Shepherd. They call him Doricles; and boasts himself
       To have a worthy feeding: but I have it
       Upon his own report and I believe it;
       He looks like sooth. He says he loves my daughter: 2060
       I think so too; for never gazed the moon
       Upon the water as he'll stand and read
       As 'twere my daughter's eyes: and, to be plain.
       I think there is not half a kiss to choose
       Who loves another best. 2065

     * Polixenes. She dances featly.

     * Old Shepherd. So she does any thing; though I report it,
       That should be silent: if young Doricles
       Do light upon her, she shall bring him that
       Which he not dreams of. 2070

   [Enter Servant]
     * Servant. O master, if you did but hear the pedlar at the
       door, you would never dance again after a tabour and
       pipe; no, the bagpipe could not move you: he sings
       several tunes faster than you'll tell money; he 2075
       utters them as he had eaten ballads and all men's
       ears grew to his tunes.

     * Clown. He could never come better; he shall come in. I
       love a ballad but even too well, if it be doleful
       matter merrily set down, or a very pleasant thing 2080
       indeed and sung lamentably.

     * Servant. He hath songs for man or woman, of all sizes; no
       milliner can so fit his customers with gloves: he
       has the prettiest love-songs for maids; so without
       bawdry, which is strange; with such delicate 2085
       burthens of dildos and fadings, 'jump her and thump
       her;' and where some stretch-mouthed rascal would,
       as it were, mean mischief and break a foul gap into
       the matter, he makes the maid to answer 'Whoop, do me
       no harm, good man;' puts him off, slights him, with 2090
       'Whoop, do me no harm, good man.'

     * Polixenes. This is a brave fellow.

     * Clown. Believe me, thou talkest of an admirable conceited
       fellow. Has he any unbraided wares?

     * Servant. He hath ribbons of an the colours i' the rainbow; 2095
       points more than all the lawyers in Bohemia can
       learnedly handle, though they come to him by the
       gross: inkles, caddisses, cambrics, lawns: why, he
       sings 'em over as they were gods or goddesses; you
       would think a smock were a she-angel, he so chants 2100
       to the sleeve-hand and the work about the square on't.

     * Clown. Prithee bring him in; and let him approach singing.

     * Perdita. Forewarn him that he use no scurrilous words in 's tunes.

   [Exit Servant]
     * Clown. You have of these pedlars, that have more in them 2105
       than you'ld think, sister.

     * Perdita. Ay, good brother, or go about to think.

   [Enter AUTOLYCUS, singing]
     * Autolycus. Lawn as white as driven snow;
       Cyprus black as e'er was crow; 2110
       Gloves as sweet as damask roses;
       Masks for faces and for noses;
       Bugle bracelet, necklace amber,
       Perfume for a lady's chamber;
       Golden quoifs and stomachers, 2115
       For my lads to give their dears:
       Pins and poking-sticks of steel,
       What maids lack from head to heel:
       Come buy of me, come; come buy, come buy;
       Buy lads, or else your lasses cry: Come buy. 2120

     * Clown. If I were not in love with Mopsa, thou shouldst take
       no money of me; but being enthralled as I am, it
       will also be the bondage of certain ribbons and gloves.

     * Mopsa. I was promised them against the feast; but they come
       not too late now. 2125

     * Dorcas. He hath promised you more than that, or there be liars.

     * Mopsa. He hath paid you all he promised you; may be, he has
       paid you more, which will shame you to give him again.

     * Clown. Is there no manners left among maids? will they
       wear their plackets where they should bear their 2130
       faces? Is there not milking-time, when you are
       going to bed, or kiln-hole, to whistle off these
       secrets, but you must be tittle-tattling before all
       our guests? 'tis well they are whispering: clamour
       your tongues, and not a word more. 2135

     * Mopsa. I have done. Come, you promised me a tawdry-lace
       and a pair of sweet gloves.

     * Clown. Have I not told thee how I was cozened by the way
       and lost all my money?

     * Autolycus. And indeed, sir, there are cozeners abroad; 2140
       therefore it behoves men to be wary.

     * Clown. Fear not thou, man, thou shalt lose nothing here.

     * Autolycus. I hope so, sir; for I have about me many parcels of
       charge.

     * Clown. What hast here? ballads?

     * Mopsa. Pray now, buy some: I love a ballad in print o' 2145
       life, for then we are sure they are true.

     * Autolycus. Here's one to a very doleful tune, how a usurer's
       wife was brought to bed of twenty money-bags at a
       burthen and how she longed to eat adders' heads and
       toads carbonadoed. 2150

     * Mopsa. Is it true, think you?

     * Autolycus. Very true, and but a month old.

     * Dorcas. Bless me from marrying a usurer!

     * Autolycus. Here's the midwife's name to't, one Mistress
       Tale-porter, and five or six honest wives that were 2155
       present. Why should I carry lies abroad?

     * Mopsa. Pray you now, buy it.

     * Clown. Come on, lay it by: and let's first see moe
       ballads; we'll buy the other things anon.

     * Autolycus. Here's another ballad of a fish, that appeared upon 2160
       the coast on Wednesday the four-score of April,
       forty thousand fathom above water, and sung this
       ballad against the hard hearts of maids: it was
       thought she was a woman and was turned into a cold
       fish for she would not exchange flesh with one that 2165
       loved her: the ballad is very pitiful and as true.

     * Dorcas. Is it true too, think you?

     * Autolycus. Five justices' hands at it, and witnesses more than
       my pack will hold.

     * Clown. Lay it by too: another. 2170

     * Autolycus. This is a merry ballad, but a very pretty one.

     * Mopsa. Let's have some merry ones.

     * Autolycus. Why, this is a passing merry one and goes to
       the tune of 'Two maids wooing a man:' there's
       scarce a maid westward but she sings it; 'tis in 2175
       request, I can tell you.

     * Mopsa. We can both sing it: if thou'lt bear a part, thou
       shalt hear; 'tis in three parts.

     * Dorcas. We had the tune on't a month ago.

     * Autolycus. I can bear my part; you must know 'tis my 2180
       occupation; have at it with you.

   [SONG]
     * Autolycus. Get you hence, for I must go
       Where it fits not you to know.

     * Dorcas. Whither? 2185

     * Mopsa. O, whither?

     * Dorcas. Whither?

     * Mopsa. It becomes thy oath full well,
       Thou to me thy secrets tell.

     * Dorcas. Me too, let me go thither. 2190

     * Mopsa. Or thou goest to the orange or mill.

     * Dorcas. If to either, thou dost ill.

     * Autolycus. Neither.

     * Dorcas. What, neither?

     * Autolycus. Neither. 2195

     * Dorcas. Thou hast sworn my love to be.

     * Mopsa. Thou hast sworn it more to me:
       Then whither goest? say, whither?

     * Clown. We'll have this song out anon by ourselves: my
       father and the gentlemen are in sad talk, and we'll 2200
       not trouble them. Come, bring away thy pack after
       me. Wenches, I'll buy for you both. Pedlar, let's
       have the first choice. Follow me, girls.

   [Exit with DORCAS and MOPSA]
     * Autolycus. And you shall pay well for 'em. 2205
       [Follows singing]
       Will you buy any tape,
       Or lace for your cape,
       My dainty duck, my dear-a?
       Any silk, any thread, 2210
       Any toys for your head,
       Of the new'st and finest, finest wear-a?
       Come to the pedlar;
       Money's a medler.
       That doth utter all men's ware-a. 2215

   [Exit]

   [Re-enter Servant]
     * Servant. Master, there is three carters, three shepherds,
       three neat-herds, three swine-herds, that have made
       themselves all men of hair, they call themselves 2220
       Saltiers, and they have a dance which the wenches
       say is a gallimaufry of gambols, because they are
       not in't; but they themselves are o' the mind, if it
       be not too rough for some that know little but
       bowling, it will please plentifully. 2225

     * Old Shepherd. Away! we'll none on 't: here has been too much
       homely foolery already. I know, sir, we weary you.

     * Polixenes. You weary those that refresh us: pray, let's see
       these four threes of herdsmen.

     * Servant. One three of them, by their own report, sir, hath 2230
       danced before the king; and not the worst of the
       three but jumps twelve foot and a half by the squier.

     * Old Shepherd. Leave your prating: since these good men are
       pleased, let them come in; but quickly now.

     * Servant. Why, they stay at door, sir. 2235

   [Exit]

   [Here a dance of twelve Satyrs]
     * Polixenes. O, father, you'll know more of that hereafter.
       [To CAMILLO]
       Is it not too far gone? 'Tis time to part them. 2240
       He's simple and tells much.
       [To FLORIZEL]
       How now, fair shepherd!
       Your heart is full of something that does take
       Your mind from feasting. Sooth, when I was young 2245
       And handed love as you do, I was wont
       To load my she with knacks: I would have ransack'd
       The pedlar's silken treasury and have pour'd it
       To her acceptance; you have let him go
       And nothing marted with him. If your lass 2250
       Interpretation should abuse and call this
       Your lack of love or bounty, you were straited
       For a reply, at least if you make a care
       Of happy holding her.

     * Florizel. Old sir, I know 2255
       She prizes not such trifles as these are:
       The gifts she looks from me are pack'd and lock'd
       Up in my heart; which I have given already,
       But not deliver'd. O, hear me breathe my life
       Before this ancient sir, who, it should seem, 2260
       Hath sometime loved! I take thy hand, this hand,
       As soft as dove's down and as white as it,
       Or Ethiopian's tooth, or the fann'd
       snow that's bolted
       By the northern blasts twice o'er. 2265

     * Polixenes. What follows this?
       How prettily the young swain seems to wash
       The hand was fair before! I have put you out:
       But to your protestation; let me hear
       What you profess. 2270

     * Florizel. Do, and be witness to 't.

     * Polixenes. And this my neighbour too?

     * Florizel. And he, and more
       Than he, and men, the earth, the heavens, and all:
       That, were I crown'd the most imperial monarch, 2275
       Thereof most worthy, were I the fairest youth
       That ever made eye swerve, had force and knowledge
       More than was ever man's, I would not prize them
       Without her love; for her employ them all;
       Commend them and condemn them to her service 2280
       Or to their own perdition.

     * Polixenes. Fairly offer'd.

     * Camillo. This shows a sound affection.

     * Old Shepherd. But, my daughter,
       Say you the like to him? 2285

     * Perdita. I cannot speak
       So well, nothing so well; no, nor mean better:
       By the pattern of mine own thoughts I cut out
       The purity of his.

     * Old Shepherd. Take hands, a bargain! 2290
       And, friends unknown, you shall bear witness to 't:
       I give my daughter to him, and will make
       Her portion equal his.

     * Florizel. O, that must be
       I' the virtue of your daughter: one being dead, 2295
       I shall have more than you can dream of yet;
       Enough then for your wonder. But, come on,
       Contract us 'fore these witnesses.

     * Old Shepherd. Come, your hand;
       And, daughter, yours. 2300

     * Polixenes. Soft, swain, awhile, beseech you;
       Have you a father?

     * Florizel. I have: but what of him?

     * Polixenes. Knows he of this?

     * Florizel. He neither does nor shall. 2305

     * Polixenes. Methinks a father
       Is at the nuptial of his son a guest
       That best becomes the table. Pray you once more,
       Is not your father grown incapable
       Of reasonable affairs? is he not stupid 2310
       With age and altering rheums? can he speak? hear?
       Know man from man? dispute his own estate?
       Lies he not bed-rid? and again does nothing
       But what he did being childish?

     * Florizel. No, good sir; 2315
       He has his health and ampler strength indeed
       Than most have of his age.

     * Polixenes. By my white beard,
       You offer him, if this be so, a wrong
       Something unfilial: reason my son 2320
       Should choose himself a wife, but as good reason
       The father, all whose joy is nothing else
       But fair posterity, should hold some counsel
       In such a business.

     * Florizel. I yield all this; 2325
       But for some other reasons, my grave sir,
       Which 'tis not fit you know, I not acquaint
       My father of this business.

     * Polixenes. Let him know't.

     * Florizel. He shall not. 2330

     * Polixenes. Prithee, let him.

     * Florizel. No, he must not.

     * Old Shepherd. Let him, my son: he shall not need to grieve
       At knowing of thy choice.

     * Florizel. Come, come, he must not. 2335
       Mark our contract.

     * Polixenes. Mark your divorce, young sir,
       [Discovering himself]
       Whom son I dare not call; thou art too base
       To be acknowledged: thou a sceptre's heir, 2340
       That thus affect'st a sheep-hook! Thou old traitor,
       I am sorry that by hanging thee I can
       But shorten thy life one week. And thou, fresh piece
       Of excellent witchcraft, who of force must know
       The royal fool thou copest with,— 2345

     * Old Shepherd. O, my heart!

     * Polixenes. I'll have thy beauty scratch'd with briers, and made
       More homely than thy state. For thee, fond boy,
       If I may ever know thou dost but sigh
       That thou no more shalt see this knack, as never 2350
       I mean thou shalt, we'll bar thee from succession;
       Not hold thee of our blood, no, not our kin,
       Far than Deucalion off: mark thou my words:
       Follow us to the court. Thou churl, for this time,
       Though full of our displeasure, yet we free thee 2355
       From the dead blow of it. And you, enchantment.—
       Worthy enough a herdsman: yea, him too,
       That makes himself, but for our honour therein,
       Unworthy thee,—if ever henceforth thou
       These rural latches to his entrance open, 2360
       Or hoop his body more with thy embraces,
       I will devise a death as cruel for thee
       As thou art tender to't.

   [Exit]
     * Perdita. Even here undone! 2365
       I was not much afeard; for once or twice
       I was about to speak and tell him plainly,
       The selfsame sun that shines upon his court
       Hides not his visage from our cottage but
       Looks on alike. Will't please you, sir, be gone? 2370
       I told you what would come of this: beseech you,
       Of your own state take care: this dream of mine,—
       Being now awake, I'll queen it no inch farther,
       But milk my ewes and weep.

     * Camillo. Why, how now, father! 2375
       Speak ere thou diest.

     * Old Shepherd. I cannot speak, nor think
       Nor dare to know that which I know. O sir!
       You have undone a man of fourscore three,
       That thought to fill his grave in quiet, yea, 2380
       To die upon the bed my father died,
       To lie close by his honest bones: but now
       Some hangman must put on my shroud and lay me
       Where no priest shovels in dust. O cursed wretch,
       That knew'st this was the prince, 2385
       and wouldst adventure
       To mingle faith with him! Undone! undone!
       If I might die within this hour, I have lived
       To die when I desire.

   [Exit]
     * Florizel. Why look you so upon me?
       I am but sorry, not afeard; delay'd,
       But nothing alter'd: what I was, I am;
       More straining on for plucking back, not following
       My leash unwillingly. 2395

     * Camillo. Gracious my lord,
       You know your father's temper: at this time
       He will allow no speech, which I do guess
       You do not purpose to him; and as hardly
       Will he endure your sight as yet, I fear: 2400
       Then, till the fury of his highness settle,
       Come not before him.

     * Florizel. I not purpose it.
       I think, Camillo?

     * Camillo. Even he, my lord. 2405

     * Perdita. How often have I told you 'twould be thus!
       How often said, my dignity would last
       But till 'twere known!

     * Florizel. It cannot fail but by
       The violation of my faith; and then 2410
       Let nature crush the sides o' the earth together
       And mar the seeds within! Lift up thy looks:
       From my succession wipe me, father; I
       Am heir to my affection.

     * Camillo. Be advised. 2415

     * Florizel. I am, and by my fancy: if my reason
       Will thereto be obedient, I have reason;
       If not, my senses, better pleased with madness,
       Do bid it welcome.

     * Camillo. This is desperate, sir. 2420

     * Florizel. So call it: but it does fulfil my vow;
       I needs must think it honesty. Camillo,
       Not for Bohemia, nor the pomp that may
       Be thereat glean'd, for all the sun sees or
       The close earth wombs or the profound sea hides 2425
       In unknown fathoms, will I break my oath
       To this my fair beloved: therefore, I pray you,
       As you have ever been my father's honour'd friend,
       When he shall miss me,—as, in faith, I mean not
       To see him any more,—cast your good counsels 2430
       Upon his passion; let myself and fortune
       Tug for the time to come. This you may know
       And so deliver, I am put to sea
       With her whom here I cannot hold on shore;
       And most opportune to our need I have 2435
       A vessel rides fast by, but not prepared
       For this design. What course I mean to hold
       Shall nothing benefit your knowledge, nor
       Concern me the reporting.

     * Camillo. O my lord! 2440
       I would your spirit were easier for advice,
       Or stronger for your need.

     * Florizel. Hark, Perdita
       [Drawing her aside]
       I'll hear you by and by. 2445

     * Camillo. He's irremoveable,
       Resolved for flight. Now were I happy, if
       His going I could frame to serve my turn,
       Save him from danger, do him love and honour,
       Purchase the sight again of dear Sicilia 2450
       And that unhappy king, my master, whom
       I so much thirst to see.

     * Florizel. Now, good Camillo;
       I am so fraught with curious business that
       I leave out ceremony. 2455

     * Camillo. Sir, I think
       You have heard of my poor services, i' the love
       That I have borne your father?

     * Florizel. Very nobly
       Have you deserved: it is my father's music 2460
       To speak your deeds, not little of his care
       To have them recompensed as thought on.

     * Camillo. Well, my lord,
       If you may please to think I love the king
       And through him what is nearest to him, which is 2465
       Your gracious self, embrace but my direction:
       If your more ponderous and settled project
       May suffer alteration, on mine honour,
       I'll point you where you shall have such receiving
       As shall become your highness; where you may 2470
       Enjoy your mistress, from the whom, I see,
       There's no disjunction to be made, but by—
       As heavens forefend!—your ruin; marry her,
       And, with my best endeavours in your absence,
       Your discontenting father strive to qualify 2475
       And bring him up to liking.

     * Florizel. How, Camillo,
       May this, almost a miracle, be done?
       That I may call thee something more than man
       And after that trust to thee. 2480

     * Camillo. Have you thought on
       A place whereto you'll go?

     * Florizel. Not any yet:
       But as the unthought-on accident is guilty
       To what we wildly do, so we profess 2485
       Ourselves to be the slaves of chance and flies
       Of every wind that blows.

     * Camillo. Then list to me:
       This follows, if you will not change your purpose
       But undergo this flight, make for Sicilia, 2490
       And there present yourself and your fair princess,
       For so I see she must be, 'fore Leontes:
       She shall be habited as it becomes
       The partner of your bed. Methinks I see
       Leontes opening his free arms and weeping 2495
       His welcomes forth; asks thee the son forgiveness,
       As 'twere i' the father's person; kisses the hands
       Of your fresh princess; o'er and o'er divides him
       'Twixt his unkindness and his kindness; the one
       He chides to hell and bids the other grow 2500
       Faster than thought or time.

     * Florizel. Worthy Camillo,
       What colour for my visitation shall I
       Hold up before him?

     * Camillo. Sent by the king your father 2505
       To greet him and to give him comforts. Sir,
       The manner of your bearing towards him, with
       What you as from your father shall deliver,
       Things known betwixt us three, I'll write you down:
       The which shall point you forth at every sitting 2510
       What you must say; that he shall not perceive
       But that you have your father's bosom there
       And speak his very heart.

     * Florizel. I am bound to you:
       There is some sap in this. 2515

     * Camillo. A cause more promising
       Than a wild dedication of yourselves
       To unpath'd waters, undream'd shores, most certain
       To miseries enough; no hope to help you,
       But as you shake off one to take another; 2520
       Nothing so certain as your anchors, who
       Do their best office, if they can but stay you
       Where you'll be loath to be: besides you know
       Prosperity's the very bond of love,
       Whose fresh complexion and whose heart together 2525
       Affliction alters.

     * Perdita. One of these is true:
       I think affliction may subdue the cheek,
       But not take in the mind.

     * Camillo. Yea, say you so? 2530
       There shall not at your father's house these
       seven years
       Be born another such.

     * Florizel. My good Camillo,
       She is as forward of her breeding as 2535
       She is i' the rear our birth.

     * Camillo. I cannot say 'tis pity
       She lacks instructions, for she seems a mistress
       To most that teach.

     * Perdita. Your pardon, sir; for this 2540
       I'll blush you thanks.

     * Florizel. My prettiest Perdita!
       But O, the thorns we stand upon! Camillo,
       Preserver of my father, now of me,
       The medicine of our house, how shall we do? 2545
       We are not furnish'd like Bohemia's son,
       Nor shall appear in Sicilia.

     * Camillo. My lord,
       Fear none of this: I think you know my fortunes
       Do all lie there: it shall be so my care 2550
       To have you royally appointed as if
       The scene you play were mine. For instance, sir,
       That you may know you shall not want, one word.

   [They talk aside]

   [Re-enter AUTOLYCUS]
     * Autolycus. Ha, ha! what a fool Honesty is! and Trust, his
       sworn brother, a very simple gentleman! I have sold
       all my trumpery; not a counterfeit stone, not a
       ribbon, glass, pomander, brooch, table-book, ballad,
       knife, tape, glove, shoe-tie, bracelet, horn-ring, 2560
       to keep my pack from fasting: they throng who
       should buy first, as if my trinkets had been
       hallowed and brought a benediction to the buyer:
       by which means I saw whose purse was best in
       picture; and what I saw, to my good use I 2565
       remembered. My clown, who wants but something to
       be a reasonable man, grew so in love with the
       wenches' song, that he would not stir his pettitoes
       till he had both tune and words; which so drew the
       rest of the herd to me that all their other senses 2570
       stuck in ears: you might have pinched a placket, it
       was senseless; 'twas nothing to geld a codpiece of a
       purse; I could have filed keys off that hung in
       chains: no hearing, no feeling, but my sir's song,
       and admiring the nothing of it. So that in this 2575
       time of lethargy I picked and cut most of their
       festival purses; and had not the old man come in
       with a whoo-bub against his daughter and the king's
       son and scared my choughs from the chaff, I had not
       left a purse alive in the whole army. 2580

   [CAMILLO, FLORIZEL, and PERDITA come forward]
     * Camillo. Nay, but my letters, by this means being there
       So soon as you arrive, shall clear that doubt.

     * Florizel. And those that you'll procure from King Leontes—

     * Camillo. Shall satisfy your father. 2585

     * Perdita. Happy be you!
       All that you speak shows fair.

     * Camillo. Who have we here?
       [Seeing AUTOLYCUS]
       We'll make an instrument of this, omit 2590
       Nothing may give us aid.

     * Autolycus. If they have overheard me now, why, hanging.

     * Camillo. How now, good fellow! why shakest thou so? Fear
       not, man; here's no harm intended to thee.

     * Autolycus. I am a poor fellow, sir. 2595

     * Camillo. Why, be so still; here's nobody will steal that from
       thee: yet for the outside of thy poverty we must
       make an exchange; therefore discase thee instantly,
       —thou must think there's a necessity in't,—and
       change garments with this gentleman: though the 2600
       pennyworth on his side be the worst, yet hold thee,
       there's some boot.

     * Autolycus. I am a poor fellow, sir.
       [Aside]
       I know ye well enough. 2605

     * Camillo. Nay, prithee, dispatch: the gentleman is half
       flayed already.

     * Autolycus. Are you in earnest, sir?
       [Aside]
       I smell the trick on't. 2610

     * Florizel. Dispatch, I prithee.

     * Autolycus. Indeed, I have had earnest: but I cannot with
       conscience take it.

     * Camillo. Unbuckle, unbuckle.
       [FLORIZEL and AUTOLYCUS exchange garments] 2615
       Fortunate mistress,—let my prophecy
       Come home to ye!—you must retire yourself
       Into some covert: take your sweetheart's hat
       And pluck it o'er your brows, muffle your face,
       Dismantle you, and, as you can, disliken 2620
       The truth of your own seeming; that you may—
       For I do fear eyes over—to shipboard
       Get undescried.

     * Perdita. I see the play so lies
       That I must bear a part. 2625

     * Camillo. No remedy.
       Have you done there?

     * Florizel. Should I now meet my father,
       He would not call me son.

     * Camillo. Nay, you shall have no hat. 2630
       [Giving it to PERDITA]
       Come, lady, come. Farewell, my friend.

     * Autolycus. Adieu, sir.

     * Florizel. O Perdita, what have we twain forgot!
       Pray you, a word. 2635

     * Camillo. [Aside] What I do next, shall be to tell the king
       Of this escape and whither they are bound;
       Wherein my hope is I shall so prevail
       To force him after: in whose company
       I shall review Sicilia, for whose sight 2640
       I have a woman's longing.

     * Florizel. Fortune speed us!
       Thus we set on, Camillo, to the sea-side.

     * Camillo. The swifter speed the better.

   [Exeunt FLORIZEL, PERDITA, and CAMILLO]
     * Autolycus. I understand the business, I hear it: to have an
       open ear, a quick eye, and a nimble hand, is
       necessary for a cut-purse; a good nose is requisite
       also, to smell out work for the other senses. I see
       this is the time that the unjust man doth thrive. 2650
       What an exchange had this been without boot! What
       a boot is here with this exchange! Sure the gods do
       this year connive at us, and we may do any thing
       extempore. The prince himself is about a piece of
       iniquity, stealing away from his father with his 2655
       clog at his heels: if I thought it were a piece of
       honesty to acquaint the king withal, I would not
       do't: I hold it the more knavery to conceal it;
       and therein am I constant to my profession.
       [Re-enter Clown and Shepherd] 2660
       Aside, aside; here is more matter for a hot brain:
       every lane's end, every shop, church, session,
       hanging, yields a careful man work.

     * Clown. See, see; what a man you are now!
       There is no other way but to tell the king 2665
       she's a changeling and none of your flesh and blood.

     * Old Shepherd. Nay, but hear me.

     * Clown. Nay, but hear me.

     * Old Shepherd. Go to, then.

     * Clown. She being none of your flesh and blood, your flesh 2670
       and blood has not offended the king; and so your
       flesh and blood is not to be punished by him. Show
       those things you found about her, those secret
       things, all but what she has with her: this being
       done, let the law go whistle: I warrant you. 2675

     * Old Shepherd. I will tell the king all, every word, yea, and his
       son's pranks too; who, I may say, is no honest man,
       neither to his father nor to me, to go about to make
       me the king's brother-in-law.

     * Clown. Indeed, brother-in-law was the farthest off you 2680
       could have been to him and then your blood had been
       the dearer by I know how much an ounce.

     * Autolycus. [Aside] Very wisely, puppies!

     * Old Shepherd. Well, let us to the king: there is that in this
       fardel will make him scratch his beard. 2685

     * Autolycus. [Aside] I know not what impediment this complaint
       may be to the flight of my master.

     * Clown. Pray heartily he be at palace.

     * Autolycus. [Aside] Though I am not naturally honest, I am so
       sometimes by chance: let me pocket up my pedlar's excrement. 2690
       [Takes off his false beard]
       How now, rustics! whither are you bound?

     * Old Shepherd. To the palace, an it like your worship.

     * Autolycus. Your affairs there, what, with whom, the condition
       of that fardel, the place of your dwelling, your 2695
       names, your ages, of what having, breeding, and any
       thing that is fitting to be known, discover.

     * Clown. We are but plain fellows, sir.

     * Autolycus. A lie; you are rough and hairy. Let me have no
       lying: it becomes none but tradesmen, and they 2700
       often give us soldiers the lie: but we pay them for
       it with stamped coin, not stabbing steel; therefore
       they do not give us the lie.

     * Clown. Your worship had like to have given us one, if you
       had not taken yourself with the manner. 2705

     * Old Shepherd. Are you a courtier, an't like you, sir?

     * Autolycus. Whether it like me or no, I am a courtier. Seest
       thou not the air of the court in these enfoldings?
       hath not my gait in it the measure of the court?
       receives not thy nose court-odor from me? reflect I 2710
       not on thy baseness court-contempt? Thinkest thou,
       for that I insinuate, or toaze from thee thy
       business, I am therefore no courtier? I am courtier
       cap-a-pe; and one that will either push on or pluck
       back thy business there: whereupon I command thee to 2715
       open thy affair.

     * Old Shepherd. My business, sir, is to the king.

     * Autolycus. What advocate hast thou to him?

     * Old Shepherd. I know not, an't like you.

     * Clown. Advocate's the court-word for a pheasant: say you 2720
       have none.

     * Old Shepherd. None, sir; I have no pheasant, cock nor hen.

     * Autolycus. How blessed are we that are not simple men!
       Yet nature might have made me as these are,
       Therefore I will not disdain. 2725

     * Clown. This cannot be but a great courtier.

     * Old Shepherd. His garments are rich, but he wears
       them not handsomely.

     * Clown. He seems to be the more noble in being fantastical:
       a great man, I'll warrant; I know by the picking 2730
       on's teeth.

     * Autolycus. The fardel there? what's i' the fardel?
       Wherefore that box?

     * Old Shepherd. Sir, there lies such secrets in this fardel and box,
       which none must know but the king; and which he 2735
       shall know within this hour, if I may come to the
       speech of him.

     * Autolycus. Age, thou hast lost thy labour.

     * Old Shepherd. Why, sir?

     * Autolycus. The king is not at the palace; he is gone aboard a 2740
       new ship to purge melancholy and air himself: for,
       if thou beest capable of things serious, thou must
       know the king is full of grief.

     * Old Shepherd. So 'tis said, sir; about his son, that should have
       married a shepherd's daughter. 2745

     * Autolycus. If that shepherd be not in hand-fast, let him fly:
       the curses he shall have, the tortures he shall
       feel, will break the back of man, the heart of monster.

     * Clown. Think you so, sir?

     * Autolycus. Not he alone shall suffer what wit can make heavy 2750
       and vengeance bitter; but those that are germane to
       him, though removed fifty times, shall all come
       under the hangman: which though it be great pity,
       yet it is necessary. An old sheep-whistling rogue a
       ram-tender, to offer to have his daughter come into 2755
       grace! Some say he shall be stoned; but that death
       is too soft for him, say I. draw our throne into a
       sheep-cote! all deaths are too few, the sharpest too easy.

     * Clown. Has the old man e'er a son, sir, do you hear. an't
       like you, sir? 2760

     * Autolycus. He has a son, who shall be flayed alive; then
       'nointed over with honey, set on the head of a
       wasp's nest; then stand till he be three quarters
       and a dram dead; then recovered again with
       aqua-vitae or some other hot infusion; then, raw as 2765
       he is, and in the hottest day prognostication
       proclaims, shall be be set against a brick-wall, the
       sun looking with a southward eye upon him, where he
       is to behold him with flies blown to death. But what
       talk we of these traitorly rascals, whose miseries 2770
       are to be smiled at, their offences being so
       capital? Tell me, for you seem to be honest plain
       men, what you have to the king: being something
       gently considered, I'll bring you where he is
       aboard, tender your persons to his presence, 2775
       whisper him in your behalfs; and if it be in man
       besides the king to effect your suits, here is man
       shall do it.

     * Clown. He seems to be of great authority: close with him,
       give him gold; and though authority be a stubborn 2780
       bear, yet he is oft led by the nose with gold: show
       the inside of your purse to the outside of his hand,
       and no more ado. Remember 'stoned,' and 'flayed alive.'

     * Old Shepherd. An't please you, sir, to undertake the business for
       us, here is that gold I have: I'll make it as much 2785
       more and leave this young man in pawn till I bring it you.

     * Autolycus. After I have done what I promised?

     * Old Shepherd. Ay, sir.

     * Autolycus. Well, give me the moiety. Are you a party in this
       business?

     * Clown. In some sort, sir: but though my case be a pitiful 2790
       one, I hope I shall not be flayed out of it.

     * Autolycus. O, that's the case of the shepherd's son: hang him,
       he'll be made an example.

     * Clown. Comfort, good comfort! We must to the king and show
       our strange sights: he must know 'tis none of your 2795
       daughter nor my sister; we are gone else. Sir, I
       will give you as much as this old man does when the
       business is performed, and remain, as he says, your
       pawn till it be brought you.

     * Autolycus. I will trust you. Walk before toward the sea-side; 2800
       go on the right hand: I will but look upon the
       hedge and follow you.

     * Clown. We are blest in this man, as I may say, even blest.

     * Old Shepherd. Let's before as he bids us: he was provided to do us
       good.

   [Exeunt Shepherd and Clown]
     * Autolycus. If I had a mind to be honest, I see Fortune would
       not suffer me: she drops booties in my mouth. I am
       courted now with a double occasion, gold and a means
       to do the prince my master good; which who knows how
       that may turn back to my advancement? I will bring 2810
       these two moles, these blind ones, aboard him: if he
       think it fit to shore them again and that the
       complaint they have to the king concerns him
       nothing, let him call me rogue for being so far
       officious; for I am proof against that title and 2815
       what shame else belongs to't. To him will I present
       them: there may be matter in it.

   [Exit]

   Act V, Scene 1

   A room in LEONTES’ palace.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   [Enter LEONTES, CLEOMENES, DION, PAULINA, and Servants]
     * Cleomenes. Sir, you have done enough, and have perform'd 2820
       A saint-like sorrow: no fault could you make,
       Which you have not redeem'd; indeed, paid down
       More penitence than done trespass: at the last,
       Do as the heavens have done, forget your evil;
       With them forgive yourself. 2825

     * Leontes. Whilst I remember
       Her and her virtues, I cannot forget
       My blemishes in them, and so still think of
       The wrong I did myself; which was so much,
       That heirless it hath made my kingdom and 2830
       Destroy'd the sweet'st companion that e'er man
       Bred his hopes out of.

     * Paulina. True, too true, my lord:
       If, one by one, you wedded all the world,
       Or from the all that are took something good, 2835
       To make a perfect woman, she you kill'd
       Would be unparallel'd.

     * Leontes. I think so. Kill'd!
       She I kill'd! I did so: but thou strikest me
       Sorely, to say I did; it is as bitter 2840
       Upon thy tongue as in my thought: now, good now,
       Say so but seldom.

     * Cleomenes. Not at all, good lady:
       You might have spoken a thousand things that would
       Have done the time more benefit and graced 2845
       Your kindness better.

     * Paulina. You are one of those
       Would have him wed again.

     * Dion. If you would not so,
       You pity not the state, nor the remembrance 2850
       Of his most sovereign name; consider little
       What dangers, by his highness' fail of issue,
       May drop upon his kingdom and devour
       Incertain lookers on. What were more holy
       Than to rejoice the former queen is well? 2855
       What holier than, for royalty's repair,
       For present comfort and for future good,
       To bless the bed of majesty again
       With a sweet fellow to't?

     * Paulina. There is none worthy, 2860
       Respecting her that's gone. Besides, the gods
       Will have fulfill'd their secret purposes;
       For has not the divine Apollo said,
       Is't not the tenor of his oracle,
       That King Leontes shall not have an heir 2865
       Till his lost child be found? which that it shall,
       Is all as monstrous to our human reason
       As my Antigonus to break his grave
       And come again to me; who, on my life,
       Did perish with the infant. 'Tis your counsel 2870
       My lord should to the heavens be contrary,
       Oppose against their wills.
       [To LEONTES]
       Care not for issue;
       The crown will find an heir: great Alexander 2875
       Left his to the worthiest; so his successor
       Was like to be the best.

     * Leontes. Good Paulina,
       Who hast the memory of Hermione,
       I know, in honour, O, that ever I 2880
       Had squared me to thy counsel! then, even now,
       I might have look'd upon my queen's full eyes,
       Have taken treasure from her lips—

     * Paulina. And left them
       More rich for what they yielded. 2885

     * Leontes. Thou speak'st truth.
       No more such wives; therefore, no wife: one worse,
       And better used, would make her sainted spirit
       Again possess her corpse, and on this stage,
       Where we're offenders now, appear soul-vex'd, 2890
       And begin, 'Why to me?'

     * Paulina. Had she such power,
       She had just cause.

     * Leontes. She had; and would incense me
       To murder her I married. 2895

     * Paulina. I should so.
       Were I the ghost that walk'd, I'ld bid you mark
       Her eye, and tell me for what dull part in't
       You chose her; then I'ld shriek, that even your ears
       Should rift to hear me; and the words that follow'd 2900
       Should be 'Remember mine.'

     * Leontes. Stars, stars,
       And all eyes else dead coals! Fear thou no wife;
       I'll have no wife, Paulina.

     * Paulina. Will you swear 2905
       Never to marry but by my free leave?

     * Leontes. Never, Paulina; so be blest my spirit!

     * Paulina. Then, good my lords, bear witness to his oath.

     * Cleomenes. You tempt him over-much.

     * Paulina. Unless another, 2910
       As like Hermione as is her picture,
       Affront his eye.CLEOMENES. Good madam,—

     * Paulina. I have done.
       Yet, if my lord will marry,—if you will, sir,
       No remedy, but you will,—give me the office 2915
       To choose you a queen: she shall not be so young
       As was your former; but she shall be such
       As, walk'd your first queen's ghost,
       it should take joy
       To see her in your arms. 2920

     * Leontes. My true Paulina,
       We shall not marry till thou bid'st us.

     * Paulina. That
       Shall be when your first queen's again in breath;
       Never till then. 2925

   [Enter a Gentleman]
     * Gentleman. One that gives out himself Prince Florizel,
       Son of Polixenes, with his princess, she
       The fairest I have yet beheld, desires access
       To your high presence. 2930

     * Leontes. What with him? he comes not
       Like to his father's greatness: his approach,
       So out of circumstance and sudden, tells us
       'Tis not a visitation framed, but forced
       By need and accident. What train? 2935

     * Gentleman. But few,
       And those but mean.

     * Leontes. His princess, say you, with him?

     * Gentleman. Ay, the most peerless piece of earth, I think,
       That e'er the sun shone bright on. 2940

     * Paulina. O Hermione,
       As every present time doth boast itself
       Above a better gone, so must thy grave
       Give way to what's seen now! Sir, you yourself
       Have said and writ so, but your writing now 2945
       Is colder than that theme, 'She had not been,
       Nor was not to be equall'd;'—thus your verse
       Flow'd with her beauty once: 'tis shrewdly ebb'd,
       To say you have seen a better.

     * Gentleman. Pardon, madam: 2950
       The one I have almost forgot,—your pardon,—
       The other, when she has obtain'd your eye,
       Will have your tongue too. This is a creature,
       Would she begin a sect, might quench the zeal
       Of all professors else, make proselytes 2955
       Of who she but bid follow.

     * Paulina. How! not women?

     * Gentleman. Women will love her, that she is a woman
       More worth than any man; men, that she is
       The rarest of all women. 2960

     * Leontes. Go, Cleomenes;
       Yourself, assisted with your honour'd friends,
       Bring them to our embracement. Still, 'tis strange
       [Exeunt CLEOMENES and others]
       He thus should steal upon us. 2965

     * Paulina. Had our prince,
       Jewel of children, seen this hour, he had pair'd
       Well with this lord: there was not full a month
       Between their births.

     * Leontes. Prithee, no more; cease; thou know'st 2970
       He dies to me again when talk'd of: sure,
       When I shall see this gentleman, thy speeches
       Will bring me to consider that which may
       Unfurnish me of reason. They are come.
       [Re-enter CLEOMENES and others, with FLORIZEL and PERDITA] 2975
       Your mother was most true to wedlock, prince;
       For she did print your royal father off,
       Conceiving you: were I but twenty-one,
       Your father's image is so hit in you,
       His very air, that I should call you brother, 2980
       As I did him, and speak of something wildly
       By us perform'd before. Most dearly welcome!
       And your fair princess,—goddess!—O, alas!
       I lost a couple, that 'twixt heaven and earth
       Might thus have stood begetting wonder as 2985
       You, gracious couple, do: and then I lost—
       All mine own folly—the society,
       Amity too, of your brave father, whom,
       Though bearing misery, I desire my life
       Once more to look on him. 2990

     * Florizel. By his command
       Have I here touch'd Sicilia and from him
       Give you all greetings that a king, at friend,
       Can send his brother: and, but infirmity
       Which waits upon worn times hath something seized 2995
       His wish'd ability, he had himself
       The lands and waters 'twixt your throne and his
       Measured to look upon you; whom he loves—
       He bade me say so—more than all the sceptres
       And those that bear them living. 3000

     * Leontes. O my brother,
       Good gentleman! the wrongs I have done thee stir
       Afresh within me, and these thy offices,
       So rarely kind, are as interpreters
       Of my behind-hand slackness. Welcome hither, 3005
       As is the spring to the earth. And hath he too
       Exposed this paragon to the fearful usage,
       At least ungentle, of the dreadful Neptune,
       To greet a man not worth her pains, much less
       The adventure of her person? 3010

     * Florizel. Good my lord,
       She came from Libya.

     * Leontes. Where the warlike Smalus,
       That noble honour'd lord, is fear'd and loved?

     * Florizel. Most royal sir, from thence; from him, whose daughter
       3015
       His tears proclaim'd his, parting with her: thence,
       A prosperous south-wind friendly, we have cross'd,
       To execute the charge my father gave me
       For visiting your highness: my best train
       I have from your Sicilian shores dismiss'd; 3020
       Who for Bohemia bend, to signify
       Not only my success in Libya, sir,
       But my arrival and my wife's in safety
       Here where we are.

     * Leontes. The blessed gods 3025
       Purge all infection from our air whilst you
       Do climate here! You have a holy father,
       A graceful gentleman; against whose person,
       So sacred as it is, I have done sin:
       For which the heavens, taking angry note, 3030
       Have left me issueless; and your father's blest,
       As he from heaven merits it, with you
       Worthy his goodness. What might I have been,
       Might I a son and daughter now have look'd on,
       Such goodly things as you! 3035

   [Enter a Lord]
     * Lord. Most noble sir,
       That which I shall report will bear no credit,
       Were not the proof so nigh. Please you, great sir,
       Bohemia greets you from himself by me; 3040
       Desires you to attach his son, who has—
       His dignity and duty both cast off—
       Fled from his father, from his hopes, and with
       A shepherd's daughter.

     * Leontes. Where's Bohemia? speak. 3045

     * Lord. Here in your city; I now came from him:
       I speak amazedly; and it becomes
       My marvel and my message. To your court
       Whiles he was hastening, in the chase, it seems,
       Of this fair couple, meets he on the way 3050
       The father of this seeming lady and
       Her brother, having both their country quitted
       With this young prince.

     * Florizel. Camillo has betray'd me;
       Whose honour and whose honesty till now 3055
       Endured all weathers.

     * Lord. Lay't so to his charge:
       He's with the king your father.

     * Leontes. Who? Camillo?

     * Lord. Camillo, sir; I spake with him; who now 3060
       Has these poor men in question. Never saw I
       Wretches so quake: they kneel, they kiss the earth;
       Forswear themselves as often as they speak:
       Bohemia stops his ears, and threatens them
       With divers deaths in death. 3065

     * Perdita. O my poor father!
       The heaven sets spies upon us, will not have
       Our contract celebrated.

     * Leontes. You are married?

     * Florizel. We are not, sir, nor are we like to be; 3070
       The stars, I see, will kiss the valleys first:
       The odds for high and low's alike.

     * Leontes. My lord,
       Is this the daughter of a king?

     * Florizel. She is, 3075
       When once she is my wife.

     * Leontes. That 'once' I see by your good father's speed
       Will come on very slowly. I am sorry,
       Most sorry, you have broken from his liking
       Where you were tied in duty, and as sorry 3080
       Your choice is not so rich in worth as beauty,
       That you might well enjoy her.

     * Florizel. Dear, look up:
       Though Fortune, visible an enemy,
       Should chase us with my father, power no jot 3085
       Hath she to change our loves. Beseech you, sir,
       Remember since you owed no more to time
       Than I do now: with thought of such affections,
       Step forth mine advocate; at your request
       My father will grant precious things as trifles. 3090

     * Leontes. Would he do so, I'ld beg your precious mistress,
       Which he counts but a trifle.

     * Paulina. Sir, my liege,
       Your eye hath too much youth in't: not a month
       'Fore your queen died, she was more worth such gazes 3095
       Than what you look on now.

     * Leontes. I thought of her,
       Even in these looks I made.
       [To FLORIZEL]
       But your petition 3100
       Is yet unanswer'd. I will to your father:
       Your honour not o'erthrown by your desires,
       I am friend to them and you: upon which errand
       I now go toward him; therefore follow me
       And mark what way I make: come, good my lord. 3105

   [Exeunt]

   Act V, Scene 2

   Before LEONTES’ palace.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   [Enter AUTOLYCUS and a Gentleman]
     * Autolycus. Beseech you, sir, were you present at this relation?

     * First Gentleman. I was by at the opening of the fardel, heard the
       old
       shepherd deliver the manner how he found it: 3110
       whereupon, after a little amazedness, we were all
       commanded out of the chamber; only this methought I
       heard the shepherd say, he found the child.

     * Autolycus. I would most gladly know the issue of it.

     * First Gentleman. I make a broken delivery of the business; but the
       3115
       changes I perceived in the king and Camillo were
       very notes of admiration: they seemed almost, with
       staring on one another, to tear the cases of their
       eyes; there was speech in their dumbness, language
       in their very gesture; they looked as they had heard 3120
       of a world ransomed, or one destroyed: a notable
       passion of wonder appeared in them; but the wisest
       beholder, that knew no more but seeing, could not
       say if the importance were joy or sorrow; but in the
       extremity of the one, it must needs be. 3125
       [Enter another Gentleman]
       Here comes a gentleman that haply knows more.
       The news, Rogero?

     * Second Gentleman. Nothing but bonfires: the oracle is fulfilled;
       the
       king's daughter is found: such a deal of wonder is 3130
       broken out within this hour that ballad-makers
       cannot be able to express it.
       [Enter a third Gentleman]
       Here comes the Lady Paulina's steward: he can
       deliver you more. How goes it now, sir? this news 3135
       which is called true is so like an old tale, that
       the verity of it is in strong suspicion: has the king
       found his heir?

     * Third Gentleman. Most true, if ever truth were pregnant by
       circumstance: that which you hear you'll swear you 3140
       see, there is such unity in the proofs. The mantle
       of Queen Hermione's, her jewel about the neck of it,
       the letters of Antigonus found with it which they
       know to be his character, the majesty of the
       creature in resemblance of the mother, the affection 3145
       of nobleness which nature shows above her breeding,
       and many other evidences proclaim her with all
       certainty to be the king's daughter. Did you see
       the meeting of the two kings?

     * Second Gentleman. No. 3150

     * Third Gentleman. Then have you lost a sight, which was to be seen,
       cannot be spoken of. There might you have beheld one
       joy crown another, so and in such manner that it
       seemed sorrow wept to take leave of them, for their
       joy waded in tears. There was casting up of eyes, 3155
       holding up of hands, with countenances of such
       distraction that they were to be known by garment,
       not by favour. Our king, being ready to leap out of
       himself for joy of his found daughter, as if that
       joy were now become a loss, cries 'O, thy mother, 3160
       thy mother!' then asks Bohemia forgiveness; then
       embraces his son-in-law; then again worries he his
       daughter with clipping her; now he thanks the old
       shepherd, which stands by like a weather-bitten
       conduit of many kings' reigns. I never heard of such 3165
       another encounter, which lames report to follow it
       and undoes description to do it.

     * Second Gentleman. What, pray you, became of Antigonus, that carried
       hence the child?

     * Third Gentleman. Like an old tale still, which will have matter to
       3170
       rehearse, though credit be asleep and not an ear
       open. He was torn to pieces with a bear: this
       avouches the shepherd's son; who has not only his
       innocence, which seems much, to justify him, but a
       handkerchief and rings of his that Paulina knows. 3175

     * First Gentleman. What became of his bark and his followers?

     * Third Gentleman. Wrecked the same instant of their master's death
       and
       in the view of the shepherd: so that all the
       instruments which aided to expose the child were
       even then lost when it was found. But O, the noble 3180
       combat that 'twixt joy and sorrow was fought in
       Paulina! She had one eye declined for the loss of
       her husband, another elevated that the oracle was
       fulfilled: she lifted the princess from the earth,
       and so locks her in embracing, as if she would pin 3185
       her to her heart that she might no more be in danger
       of losing.

     * First Gentleman. The dignity of this act was worth the audience of
       kings and princes; for by such was it acted.

     * Third Gentleman. One of the prettiest touches of all and that which
       3190
       angled for mine eyes, caught the water though not
       the fish, was when, at the relation of the queen's
       death, with the manner how she came to't bravely
       confessed and lamented by the king, how
       attentiveness wounded his daughter; till, from one 3195
       sign of dolour to another, she did, with an 'Alas,'
       I would fain say, bleed tears, for I am sure my
       heart wept blood. Who was most marble there changed
       colour; some swooned, all sorrowed: if all the world
       could have seen 't, the woe had been universal. 3200

     * First Gentleman. Are they returned to the court?

     * Third Gentleman. No: the princess hearing of her mother's statue,
       which is in the keeping of Paulina,—a piece many
       years in doing and now newly performed by that rare
       Italian master, Julio Romano, who, had he himself 3205
       eternity and could put breath into his work, would
       beguile Nature of her custom, so perfectly he is her
       ape: he so near to Hermione hath done Hermione that
       they say one would speak to her and stand in hope of
       answer: thither with all greediness of affection 3210
       are they gone, and there they intend to sup.

     * Second Gentleman. I thought she had some great matter there in
       hand;
       for she hath privately twice or thrice a day, ever
       since the death of Hermione, visited that removed
       house. Shall we thither and with our company piece 3215
       the rejoicing?

     * First Gentleman. Who would be thence that has the benefit of
       access?
       every wink of an eye some new grace will be born:
       our absence makes us unthrifty to our knowledge.
       Let's along. 3220

   [Exeunt Gentlemen]
     * Autolycus. Now, had I not the dash of my former life in me,
       would preferment drop on my head. I brought the old
       man and his son aboard the prince: told him I heard
       them talk of a fardel and I know not what: but he 3225
       at that time, overfond of the shepherd's daughter,
       so he then took her to be, who began to be much
       sea-sick, and himself little better, extremity of
       weather continuing, this mystery remained
       undiscovered. But 'tis all one to me; for had I 3230
       been the finder out of this secret, it would not
       have relished among my other discredits.
       [Enter Shepherd and Clown]
       Here come those I have done good to against my will,
       and already appearing in the blossoms of their fortune. 3235

     * Old Shepherd. Come, boy; I am past moe children, but thy sons and
       daughters will be all gentlemen born.

     * Clown. You are well met, sir. You denied to fight with me
       this other day, because I was no gentleman born.
       See you these clothes? say you see them not and 3240
       think me still no gentleman born: you were best say
       these robes are not gentlemen born: give me the
       lie, do, and try whether I am not now a gentleman born.

     * Autolycus. I know you are now, sir, a gentleman born.

     * Clown. Ay, and have been so any time these four hours. 3245

     * Old Shepherd. And so have I, boy.

     * Clown. So you have: but I was a gentleman born before my
       father; for the king's son took me by the hand, and
       called me brother; and then the two kings called my
       father brother; and then the prince my brother and 3250
       the princess my sister called my father father; and
       so we wept, and there was the first gentleman-like
       tears that ever we shed.

     * Old Shepherd. We may live, son, to shed many more.

     * Clown. Ay; or else 'twere hard luck, being in so 3255
       preposterous estate as we are.

     * Autolycus. I humbly beseech you, sir, to pardon me all the
       faults I have committed to your worship and to give
       me your good report to the prince my master.

     * Old Shepherd. Prithee, son, do; for we must be gentle, now we are
       3260
       gentlemen.

     * Clown. Thou wilt amend thy life?

     * Autolycus. Ay, an it like your good worship.

     * Clown. Give me thy hand: I will swear to the prince thou
       art as honest a true fellow as any is in Bohemia. 3265

     * Old Shepherd. You may say it, but not swear it.

     * Clown. Not swear it, now I am a gentleman? Let boors and
       franklins say it, I'll swear it.

     * Old Shepherd. How if it be false, son?

     * Clown. If it be ne'er so false, a true gentleman may swear 3270
       it in the behalf of his friend: and I'll swear to
       the prince thou art a tall fellow of thy hands and
       that thou wilt not be drunk; but I know thou art no
       tall fellow of thy hands and that thou wilt be
       drunk: but I'll swear it, and I would thou wouldst 3275
       be a tall fellow of thy hands.

     * Autolycus. I will prove so, sir, to my power.

     * Clown. Ay, by any means prove a tall fellow: if I do not
       wonder how thou darest venture to be drunk, not
       being a tall fellow, trust me not. Hark! the kings 3280
       and the princes, our kindred, are going to see the
       queen's picture. Come, follow us: we'll be thy
       good masters.

   [Exeunt]

   Act V, Scene 3

   A chapel in PAULINA’S house.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   [Enter LEONTES, POLIXENES, FLORIZEL, PERDITA,] [p]CAMILLO, PAULINA,
   Lords, and Attendants]
     * Leontes. O grave and good Paulina, the great comfort
       That I have had of thee!

     * Paulina. What, sovereign sir,
       I did not well I meant well. All my services 3290
       You have paid home: but that you have vouchsafed,
       With your crown'd brother and these your contracted
       Heirs of your kingdoms, my poor house to visit,
       It is a surplus of your grace, which never
       My life may last to answer. 3295

     * Leontes. O Paulina,
       We honour you with trouble: but we came
       To see the statue of our queen: your gallery
       Have we pass'd through, not without much content
       In many singularities; but we saw not 3300
       That which my daughter came to look upon,
       The statue of her mother.

     * Paulina. As she lived peerless,
       So her dead likeness, I do well believe,
       Excels whatever yet you look'd upon 3305
       Or hand of man hath done; therefore I keep it
       Lonely, apart. But here it is: prepare
       To see the life as lively mock'd as ever
       Still sleep mock'd death: behold, and say 'tis well.
       [PAULINA draws a curtain, and discovers HERMIONE] 3310
       standing like a statue]
       I like your silence, it the more shows off
       Your wonder: but yet speak; first, you, my liege,
       Comes it not something near?

     * Leontes. Her natural posture! 3315
       Chide me, dear stone, that I may say indeed
       Thou art Hermione; or rather, thou art she
       In thy not chiding, for she was as tender
       As infancy and grace. But yet, Paulina,
       Hermione was not so much wrinkled, nothing 3320
       So aged as this seems.

     * Polixenes. O, not by much.

     * Paulina. So much the more our carver's excellence;
       Which lets go by some sixteen years and makes her
       As she lived now. 3325

     * Leontes. As now she might have done,
       So much to my good comfort, as it is
       Now piercing to my soul. O, thus she stood,
       Even with such life of majesty, warm life,
       As now it coldly stands, when first I woo'd her! 3330
       I am ashamed: does not the stone rebuke me
       For being more stone than it? O royal piece,
       There's magic in thy majesty, which has
       My evils conjured to remembrance and
       From thy admiring daughter took the spirits, 3335
       Standing like stone with thee.

     * Perdita. And give me leave,
       And do not say 'tis superstition, that
       I kneel and then implore her blessing. Lady,
       Dear queen, that ended when I but began, 3340
       Give me that hand of yours to kiss.

     * Paulina. O, patience!
       The statue is but newly fix'd, the colour's Not dry.

     * Camillo. My lord, your sorrow was too sore laid on,
       Which sixteen winters cannot blow away, 3345
       So many summers dry; scarce any joy
       Did ever so long live; no sorrow
       But kill'd itself much sooner.

     * Polixenes. Dear my brother,
       Let him that was the cause of this have power 3350
       To take off so much grief from you as he
       Will piece up in himself.

     * Paulina. Indeed, my lord,
       If I had thought the sight of my poor image
       Would thus have wrought you,—for the stone is mine— 3355
       I'ld not have show'd it.

     * Leontes. Do not draw the curtain.

     * Paulina. No longer shall you gaze on't, lest your fancy
       May think anon it moves.

     * Leontes. Let be, let be. 3360
       Would I were dead, but that, methinks, already—
       What was he that did make it? See, my lord,
       Would you not deem it breathed? and that those veins
       Did verily bear blood?

     * Polixenes. Masterly done: 3365
       The very life seems warm upon her lip.

     * Leontes. The fixture of her eye has motion in't,
       As we are mock'd with art.

     * Paulina. I'll draw the curtain:
       My lord's almost so far transported that 3370
       He'll think anon it lives.

     * Leontes. O sweet Paulina,
       Make me to think so twenty years together!
       No settled senses of the world can match
       The pleasure of that madness. Let 't alone. 3375

     * Paulina. I am sorry, sir, I have thus far stirr'd you: but
       I could afflict you farther.

     * Leontes. Do, Paulina;
       For this affliction has a taste as sweet
       As any cordial comfort. Still, methinks, 3380
       There is an air comes from her: what fine chisel
       Could ever yet cut breath? Let no man mock me,
       For I will kiss her.

     * Paulina. Good my lord, forbear:
       The ruddiness upon her lip is wet; 3385
       You'll mar it if you kiss it, stain your own
       With oily painting. Shall I draw the curtain?

     * Leontes. No, not these twenty years.

     * Perdita. So long could I
       Stand by, a looker on. 3390

     * Paulina. Either forbear,
       Quit presently the chapel, or resolve you
       For more amazement. If you can behold it,
       I'll make the statue move indeed, descend
       And take you by the hand; but then you'll think— 3395
       Which I protest against—I am assisted
       By wicked powers.

     * Leontes. What you can make her do,
       I am content to look on: what to speak,
       I am content to hear; for 'tis as easy 3400
       To make her speak as move.

     * Paulina. It is required
       You do awake your faith. Then all stand still;
       On: those that think it is unlawful business
       I am about, let them depart. 3405

     * Leontes. Proceed:
       No foot shall stir.

     * Paulina. Music, awake her; strike!
       [Music]
       'Tis time; descend; be stone no more; approach; 3410
       Strike all that look upon with marvel. Come,
       I'll fill your grave up: stir, nay, come away,
       Bequeath to death your numbness, for from him
       Dear life redeems you. You perceive she stirs:
       [HERMIONE comes down] 3415
       Start not; her actions shall be holy as
       You hear my spell is lawful: do not shun her
       Until you see her die again; for then
       You kill her double. Nay, present your hand:
       When she was young you woo'd her; now in age 3420
       Is she become the suitor?

     * Leontes. O, she's warm!
       If this be magic, let it be an art
       Lawful as eating.

     * Polixenes. She embraces him. 3425

     * Camillo. She hangs about his neck:
       If she pertain to life let her speak too.

     * Polixenes. Ay, and make't manifest where she has lived,
       Or how stolen from the dead.

     * Paulina. That she is living, 3430
       Were it but told you, should be hooted at
       Like an old tale: but it appears she lives,
       Though yet she speak not. Mark a little while.
       Please you to interpose, fair madam: kneel
       And pray your mother's blessing. Turn, good lady; 3435
       Our Perdita is found.

     * Hermione. You gods, look down
       And from your sacred vials pour your graces
       Upon my daughter's head! Tell me, mine own.
       Where hast thou been preserved? where lived? how found 3440
       Thy father's court? for thou shalt hear that I,
       Knowing by Paulina that the oracle
       Gave hope thou wast in being, have preserved
       Myself to see the issue.

     * Paulina. There's time enough for that; 3445
       Lest they desire upon this push to trouble
       Your joys with like relation. Go together,
       You precious winners all; your exultation
       Partake to every one. I, an old turtle,
       Will wing me to some wither'd bough and there 3450
       My mate, that's never to be found again,
       Lament till I am lost.

     * Leontes. O, peace, Paulina!
       Thou shouldst a husband take by my consent,
       As I by thine a wife: this is a match, 3455
       And made between's by vows. Thou hast found mine;
       But how, is to be question'd; for I saw her,
       As I thought, dead, and have in vain said many
       A prayer upon her grave. I'll not seek far—
       For him, I partly know his mind—to find thee 3460
       An honourable husband. Come, Camillo,
       And take her by the hand, whose worth and honesty
       Is richly noted and here justified
       By us, a pair of kings. Let's from this place.
       What! look upon my brother: both your pardons, 3465
       That e'er I put between your holy looks
       My ill suspicion. This is your son-in-law,
       And son unto the king, who, heavens directing,
       Is troth-plight to your daughter. Good Paulina,
       Lead us from hence, where we may leisurely 3470
       Each one demand an answer to his part
       Perform'd in this wide gap of time since first
       We were dissever'd: hastily lead away.
