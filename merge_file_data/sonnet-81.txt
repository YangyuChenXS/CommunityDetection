                                SONNET LXXXI

                    Or I shall live your epitaph to make,
                  Or you survive when I in earth am rotten;
                  From hence your memory death cannot take,
                 Although in me each part will be forgotten.
              Your name from hence immortal life shall have, 5
               Though I, once gone, to all the world must die:
                 The earth can yield me but a common grave,
                 When you entombed in men's eyes shall lie.
                   Your monument shall be my gentle verse,
               Which eyes not yet created shall o'er-read, 10
                 And tongues to be your being shall rehearse
               When all the breathers of this world are dead;
                 You still shall live--such virtue hath my pen--
            Where breath most breathes, even in the mouths of men. 14
