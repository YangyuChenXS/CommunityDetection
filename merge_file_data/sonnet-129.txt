                                SONNET CXXIX

                  The expense of spirit in a waste of shame
                  Is lust in action; and till action, lust
               Is perjured, murderous, bloody, full of blame,
                 Savage, extreme, rude, cruel, not to trust,
                 Enjoy'd no sooner but despised straight, 5
                    Past reason hunted, and no sooner had
                   Past reason hated, as a swallow'd bait
                   On purpose laid to make the taker mad;
                    Mad in pursuit and in possession so;
               Had, having, and in quest to have, extreme; 10
                  A bliss in proof, and proved, a very woe;
                  Before, a joy proposed; behind, a dream.
               All this the world well knows; yet none knows well
               To shun the heaven that leads men to this hell. 14
