                                SONNET CXLVII

                    My love is as a fever, longing still
                 For that which longer nurseth the disease,
                Feeding on that which doth preserve the ill,
                  The uncertain sickly appetite to please.
                   My reason, the physician to my love, 5
                 Angry that his prescriptions are not kept,
                  Hath left me, and I desperate now approve
                  Desire is death, which physic did except.
                  Past cure I am, now reason is past care,
                  And frantic-mad with evermore unrest; 10
                My thoughts and my discourse as madmen's are,
                 At random from the truth vainly express'd;
               For I have sworn thee fair and thought thee bright,
                 Who art as black as hell, as dark as night. 14
