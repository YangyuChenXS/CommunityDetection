                                 SONNET CLIV

                    The little Love-god lying once asleep
                 Laid by his side his heart-inflaming brand,
              Whilst many nymphs that vow'd chaste life to keep
                  Came tripping by; but in her maiden hand
                   The fairest votary took up that fire 5
                Which many legions of true hearts had warm'd;
                      And so the general of hot desire
                   Was sleeping by a virgin hand disarm'd.
                 This brand she quenched in a cool well by,
               Which from Love's fire took heat perpetual, 10
                     Growing a bath and healthful remedy
                For men diseased; but I, my mistress' thrall,
                 Came there for cure, and this by that I prove,
                Love's fire heats water, water cools not love. 14
