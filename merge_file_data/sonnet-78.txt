                               SONNET LXXVIII

                   So oft have I invoked thee for my Muse
                 And found such fair assistance in my verse
                     As every alien pen hath got my use
                    And under thee their poesy disperse.
              Thine eyes that taught the dumb on high to sing 5
                      And heavy ignorance aloft to fly
                  Have added feathers to the learned's wing
                      And given grace a double majesty.
                 Yet be most proud of that which I compile,
                Whose influence is thine and born of thee: 10
               In others' works thou dost but mend the style,
                  And arts with thy sweet graces graced be;
                    But thou art all my art and dost advance
                    As high as learning my rude ignorance. 14

                                      O
