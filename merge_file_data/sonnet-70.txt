                                 SONNET LXX

                That thou art blamed shall not be thy defect,
                  For slander's mark was ever yet the fair;
                     The ornament of beauty is suspect,
                 A crow that flies in heaven's sweetest air.
                 So thou be good, slander doth but approve 5
                 Thy worth the greater, being woo'd of time;
                For canker vice the sweetest buds doth love,
                 And thou present'st a pure unstained prime.
                Thou hast pass'd by the ambush of young days,
               Either not assail'd or victor being charged; 10
                Yet this thy praise cannot be so thy praise,
                      To tie up envy evermore enlarged:
                   If some suspect of ill mask'd not thy show,
               Then thou alone kingdoms of hearts shouldst owe. 14

                                      O
