                                 SONNET LXIV

                When I have seen by Time's fell hand defaced
                 The rich proud cost of outworn buried age;
                 When sometime lofty towers I see down-razed
                   And brass eternal slave to mortal rage;
                  When I have seen the hungry ocean gain 5
                   Advantage on the kingdom of the shore,
                  And the firm soil win of the watery main,
               Increasing store with loss and loss with store;
                 When I have seen such interchange of state,
                   Or state itself confounded to decay; 10
                    Ruin hath taught me thus to ruminate,
                 That Time will come and take my love away.
                 This thought is as a death, which cannot choose
                But weep to have that which it fears to lose. 14
