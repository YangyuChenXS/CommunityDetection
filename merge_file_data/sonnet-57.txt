                                 SONNET LVII

                 Being your slave, what should I do but tend
                  Upon the hours and times of your desire?
                  I have no precious time at all to spend,
                    Nor services to do, till you require.
                Nor dare I chide the world-without-end hour 5
              Whilst I, my sovereign, watch the clock for you,
                  Nor think the bitterness of absence sour
                 When you have bid your servant once adieu;
                 Nor dare I question with my jealous thought
                Where you may be, or your affairs suppose, 10
               But, like a sad slave, stay and think of nought
                Save, where you are how happy you make those.
                    So true a fool is love that in your will,
                  Though you do any thing, he thinks no ill. 14
