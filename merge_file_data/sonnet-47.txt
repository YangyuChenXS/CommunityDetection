                                SONNET XLVII

                Betwixt mine eye and heart a league is took,
                And each doth good turns now unto the other:
                 When that mine eye is famish'd for a look,
              Or heart in love with sighs himself doth smother,
               With my love's picture then my eye doth feast 5
                  And to the painted banquet bids my heart;
                  Another time mine eye is my heart's guest
               And in his thoughts of love doth share a part:
                    So, either by thy picture or my love,
                  Thyself away art resent still with me; 10
              For thou not farther than my thoughts canst move,
                And I am still with them and they with thee;
                   Or, if they sleep, thy picture in my sight
                Awakes my heart to heart's and eye's delight. 14
