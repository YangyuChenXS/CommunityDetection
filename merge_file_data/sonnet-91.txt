               Some glory in their birth, some in their skill,
             Some in their wealth, some in their bodies' force,
               Some in their garments, though new-fangled ill,
            Some in their hawks and hounds, some in their horse;
                And every humour hath his adjunct pleasure, 5
                   Wherein it finds a joy above the rest:
                  But these particulars are not my measure;
                   All these I better in one general best.
                  Thy love is better than high birth to me,
             Richer than wealth, prouder than garments' cost, 10
                  Of more delight than hawks or horses be;
                And having thee, of all men's pride I boast:
                  Wretched in this alone, that thou mayst take
                   All this away and me most wretched make. 14
