                                SONNET CXXVI

                   O thou, my lovely boy, who in thy power
              Dost hold Time's fickle glass, his sickle, hour;
                Who hast by waning grown, and therein show'st
               Thy lovers withering as thy sweet self grow'st;
                 If Nature, sovereign mistress over wrack, 5
             As thou goest onwards, still will pluck thee back,
               She keeps thee to this purpose, that her skill
                May time disgrace and wretched minutes kill.
                Yet fear her, O thou minion of her pleasure!
            She may detain, but not still keep, her treasure: 10
                Her audit, though delay'd, answer'd must be,
                     And her quietus is to render thee.
                                     (    )
                                    (    ) 14

                                      O
