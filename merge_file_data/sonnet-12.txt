                                 SONNET XII

               When I do count the clock that tells the time,
                And see the brave day sunk in hideous night;
                    When I behold the violet past prime,
                And sable curls all silver'd o'er with white;
                  When lofty trees I see barren of leaves 5
                  Which erst from heat did canopy the herd,
                 And summer's green all girded up in sheaves
               Borne on the bier with white and bristly beard,
                   Then of thy beauty do I question make,
               That thou among the wastes of time must go, 10
               Since sweets and beauties do themselves forsake
                  And die as fast as they see others grow;
               And nothing 'gainst Time's scythe can make defence
              Save breed, to brave him when he takes thee hence. 14
