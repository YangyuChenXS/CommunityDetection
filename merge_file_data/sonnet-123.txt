              No, Time, thou shalt not boast that I do change:
                   Thy pyramids built up with newer might
                  To me are nothing novel, nothing strange;
                  They are but dressings of a former sight.
               Our dates are brief, and therefore we admire 5
                  What thou dost foist upon us that is old,
                   And rather make them born to our desire
               Than think that we before have heard them told.
                     Thy registers and thee I both defy,
                Not wondering at the present nor the past, 10
                  For thy records and what we see doth lie,
                  Made more or less by thy continual haste.
                      This I do vow and this shall ever be;
                 I will be true, despite thy scythe and thee. 14
