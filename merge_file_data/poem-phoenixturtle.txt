The Phoenix and the Turtle
1601

                        Let the bird of loudest lay,
                          On the sole Arabian tree,
                         Herald sad and trumpet be,
                      To whose sound chaste wings obey.

                       But thou shrieking harbinger, 5
                        Foul precurrer of the fiend,
                          Augur of the fever's end,
                      To this troop come thou not near!

                         From this session interdict
                        Every fowl of tyrant wing, 10
                       Save the eagle, feather'd king:
                         Keep the obsequy so strict.

                      Let the priest in surplice white,
                         That defunctive music can,
                       Be the death-divining swan, 15
                      Lest the requiem lack his right.

                         And thou treble-dated crow,
                        That thy sable gender makest
                   With the breath thou givest and takest,
                   'Mongst our mourners shalt thou go. 20

                       Here the anthem doth commence:
                         Love and constancy is dead;
                         Phoenix and the turtle fled
                        In a mutual flame from hence.

                     So they loved, as love in twain 25
                         Had the essence but in one;
                        Two distincts, division none:
                       Number there in love was slain.

                       Hearts remote, yet not asunder;
                     Distance, and no space was seen 30
                      'Twixt the turtle and his queen:
                        But in them it were a wonder.

                       So between them love did shine,
                        That the turtle saw his right
                      Flaming in the phoenix' sight; 35
                        Either was the other's mine.

                         Property was thus appalled,
                       That the self was not the same;
                         Single nature's double name
                     Neither two nor one was called. 40

                        Reason, in itself confounded,
                         Saw division grow together,
                      To themselves yet either neither,
                       Simple were so well compounded,

                     That it cried, How true a twain 45
                        Seemeth this concordant one!
                       Love hath reason, reason none,
                        If what parts can so remain.

                        Whereupon it made this threne
                       To the phoenix and the dove, 50
                       Co-supremes and stars of love,
                      As chorus to their tragic scene.

                                  THRENOS.

                         Beauty, truth, and rarity,
                         Grace in all simplicity, 55
                        Here enclosed in cinders lie.

                       Death is now the phoenix' nest
                        And the turtle's loyal breast
                           To eternity doth rest,

                          Leaving no posterity: 60
                         'Twas not their infirmity,
                          It was married chastity.

                       Truth may seem, but cannot be:
                       Beauty brag, but 'tis not she;
                       Truth and beauty buried be. 65

                        To this urn let those repair
                        That are either true or fair
                     For these dead birds sigh a prayer.
