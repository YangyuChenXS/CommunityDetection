   Act I, Scene 1

   Athens. A hall in Timon’s house.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   [Enter Poet, Painter, Jeweller, Merchant, and] [p]others, at several
   doors]
     * Poet. Good day, sir.

     * Painter. I am glad you're well.

     * Poet. I have not seen you long: how goes the world? 5

     * Painter. It wears, sir, as it grows.

     * Poet. Ay, that's well known:
       But what particular rarity? what strange,
       Which manifold record not matches? See,
       Magic of bounty! all these spirits thy power 10
       Hath conjured to attend. I know the merchant.

     * Painter. I know them both; th' other's a jeweller.

     * Merchant. O, 'tis a worthy lord.

     * Jeweller. Nay, that's most fix'd.

     * Merchant. A most incomparable man, breathed, as it were, 15
       To an untirable and continuate goodness:
       He passes.

     * Merchant. O, pray, let's see't: for the Lord Timon, sir?

     * Poet. [Reciting to himself] 'When we for recompense have
       praised the vile,
       It stains the glory in that happy verse
       Which aptly sings the good.'

     * Merchant. 'Tis a good form. 25

   [Looking at the jewel]
     * Jeweller. And rich: here is a water, look ye.

     * Painter. You are rapt, sir, in some work, some dedication
       To the great lord.

     * Poet. A thing slipp'd idly from me. 30
       Our poesy is as a gum, which oozes
       From whence 'tis nourish'd: the fire i' the flint
       Shows not till it be struck; our gentle flame
       Provokes itself and like the current flies
       Each bound it chafes. What have you there? 35

     * Painter. A picture, sir. When comes your book forth?

     * Poet. Upon the heels of my presentment, sir.
       Let's see your piece.

     * Painter. 'Tis a good piece.

     * Poet. So 'tis: this comes off well and excellent. 40

     * Painter. Indifferent.

     * Poet. Admirable: how this grace
       Speaks his own standing! what a mental power
       This eye shoots forth! how big imagination
       Moves in this lip! to the dumbness of the gesture 45
       One might interpret.

     * Painter. It is a pretty mocking of the life.
       Here is a touch; is't good?

     * Poet. I will say of it,
       It tutors nature: artificial strife 50
       Lives in these touches, livelier than life.

   [Enter certain Senators, and pass over]
     * Painter. How this lord is follow'd!

     * Poet. The senators of Athens: happy man!

     * Painter. Look, more! 55

     * Poet. You see this confluence, this great flood
       of visitors.
       I have, in this rough work, shaped out a man,
       Whom this beneath world doth embrace and hug
       With amplest entertainment: my free drift 60
       Halts not particularly, but moves itself
       In a wide sea of wax: no levell'd malice
       Infects one comma in the course I hold;
       But flies an eagle flight, bold and forth on,
       Leaving no tract behind. 65

     * Painter. How shall I understand you?

     * Poet. I will unbolt to you.
       You see how all conditions, how all minds,
       As well of glib and slippery creatures as
       Of grave and austere quality, tender down 70
       Their services to Lord Timon: his large fortune
       Upon his good and gracious nature hanging
       Subdues and properties to his love and tendance
       All sorts of hearts; yea, from the glass-faced flatterer
       To Apemantus, that few things loves better 75
       Than to abhor himself: even he drops down
       The knee before him, and returns in peace
       Most rich in Timon's nod.

     * Painter. I saw them speak together.

     * Poet. Sir, I have upon a high and pleasant hill 80
       Feign'd Fortune to be throned: the base o' the mount
       Is rank'd with all deserts, all kind of natures,
       That labour on the bosom of this sphere
       To propagate their states: amongst them all,
       Whose eyes are on this sovereign lady fix'd, 85
       One do I personate of Lord Timon's frame,
       Whom Fortune with her ivory hand wafts to her;
       Whose present grace to present slaves and servants
       Translates his rivals.

     * Painter. 'Tis conceived to scope. 90
       This throne, this Fortune, and this hill, methinks,
       With one man beckon'd from the rest below,
       Bowing his head against the sleepy mount
       To climb his happiness, would be well express'd
       In our condition. 95

     * Poet. Nay, sir, but hear me on.
       All those which were his fellows but of late,
       Some better than his value, on the moment
       Follow his strides, his lobbies fill with tendance,
       Rain sacrificial whisperings in his ear, 100
       Make sacred even his stirrup, and through him
       Drink the free air.

     * Painter. Ay, marry, what of these?

     * Poet. When Fortune in her shift and change of mood
       Spurns down her late beloved, all his dependants 105
       Which labour'd after him to the mountain's top
       Even on their knees and hands, let him slip down,
       Not one accompanying his declining foot.

     * Painter. 'Tis common:
       A thousand moral paintings I can show 110
       That shall demonstrate these quick blows of Fortune's
       More pregnantly than words. Yet you do well
       To show Lord Timon that mean eyes have seen
       The foot above the head.
       [Trumpets sound. Enter TIMON, addressing himself] 115
       courteously to every suitor; a Messenger from
       VENTIDIUS talking with him; LUCILIUS and other
       servants following]

     * Timon. Imprison'd is he, say you?

     * Messenger. Ay, my good lord: five talents is his debt, 120
       His means most short, his creditors most strait:
       Your honourable letter he desires
       To those have shut him up; which failing,
       Periods his comfort.

     * Timon. Noble Ventidius! Well; 125
       I am not of that feather to shake off
       My friend when he must need me. I do know him
       A gentleman that well deserves a help:
       Which he shall have: I'll pay the debt,
       and free him. 130

     * Messenger. Your lordship ever binds him.

     * Timon. Commend me to him: I will send his ransom;
       And being enfranchised, bid him come to me.
       'Tis not enough to help the feeble up,
       But to support him after. Fare you well. 135

     * Messenger. All happiness to your honour!

   [Exit]

   [Enter an old Athenian]
     * Old Athenian. Lord Timon, hear me speak.

     * Timon. Freely, good father. 140

     * Old Athenian. Thou hast a servant named Lucilius.

     * Timon. I have so: what of him?

     * Old Athenian. Most noble Timon, call the man before thee.

     * Timon. Attends he here, or no? Lucilius!

     * Lucilius. Here, at your lordship's service. 145

     * Old Athenian. This fellow here, Lord Timon, this thy creature,
       By night frequents my house. I am a man
       That from my first have been inclined to thrift;
       And my estate deserves an heir more raised
       Than one which holds a trencher. 150

     * Timon. Well; what further?

     * Old Athenian. One only daughter have I, no kin else,
       On whom I may confer what I have got:
       The maid is fair, o' the youngest for a bride,
       And I have bred her at my dearest cost 155
       In qualities of the best. This man of thine
       Attempts her love: I prithee, noble lord,
       Join with me to forbid him her resort;
       Myself have spoke in vain.

     * Timon. The man is honest. 160

     * Old Athenian. Therefore he will be, Timon:
       His honesty rewards him in itself;
       It must not bear my daughter.

     * Timon. Does she love him?

     * Old Athenian. She is young and apt: 165
       Our own precedent passions do instruct us
       What levity's in youth.

     * Timon. [To LUCILIUS] Love you the maid?

     * Lucilius. Ay, my good lord, and she accepts of it.

     * Old Athenian. If in her marriage my consent be missing, 170
       I call the gods to witness, I will choose
       Mine heir from forth the beggars of the world,
       And dispossess her all.

     * Timon. How shall she be endow'd,
       if she be mated with an equal husband? 175

     * Old Athenian. Three talents on the present; in future, all.

     * Timon. This gentleman of mine hath served me long:
       To build his fortune I will strain a little,
       For 'tis a bond in men. Give him thy daughter:
       What you bestow, in him I'll counterpoise, 180
       And make him weigh with her.

     * Old Athenian. Most noble lord,
       Pawn me to this your honour, she is his.

     * Timon. My hand to thee; mine honour on my promise.

     * Lucilius. Humbly I thank your lordship: never may 185
       The state or fortune fall into my keeping,
       Which is not owed to you!

   [Exeunt LUCILIUS and Old Athenian]
     * Poet. Vouchsafe my labour, and long live your lordship!

     * Timon. I thank you; you shall hear from me anon: 190
       Go not away. What have you there, my friend?

     * Painter. A piece of painting, which I do beseech
       Your lordship to accept.

     * Timon. Painting is welcome.
       The painting is almost the natural man; 195
       or since dishonour traffics with man's nature,
       He is but outside: these pencill'd figures are
       Even such as they give out. I like your work;
       And you shall find I like it: wait attendance
       Till you hear further from me. 200

     * Painter. The gods preserve ye!

     * Timon. Well fare you, gentleman: give me your hand;
       We must needs dine together. Sir, your jewel
       Hath suffer'd under praise.

     * Jeweller. What, my lord! dispraise? 205

     * Timon. A more satiety of commendations.
       If I should pay you for't as 'tis extoll'd,
       It would unclew me quite.

     * Jeweller. My lord, 'tis rated
       As those which sell would give: but you well know, 210
       Things of like value differing in the owners
       Are prized by their masters: believe't, dear lord,
       You mend the jewel by the wearing it.

     * Timon. Well mock'd.

     * Merchant. No, my good lord; he speaks the common tongue, 215
       Which all men speak with him.

     * Timon. Look, who comes here: will you be chid?

   [Enter APEMANTUS]
     * Merchant. He'll spare none. 220

     * Timon. Good morrow to thee, gentle Apemantus!

     * Apemantus. Till I be gentle, stay thou for thy good morrow;
       When thou art Timon's dog, and these knaves honest.

     * Timon. Why dost thou call them knaves? thou know'st them not.

     * Apemantus. Are they not Athenians? 225

     * Timon. Yes.

     * Apemantus. Then I repent not.

     * Apemantus. Thou know'st I do: I call'd thee by thy name.

     * Timon. Thou art proud, Apemantus. 230

     * Apemantus. Of nothing so much as that I am not like Timon.

     * Timon. Whither art going?

     * Apemantus. To knock out an honest Athenian's brains.

     * Timon. That's a deed thou'lt die for.

     * Apemantus. Right, if doing nothing be death by the law. 235

     * Timon. How likest thou this picture, Apemantus?

     * Apemantus. The best, for the innocence.

     * Timon. Wrought he not well that painted it?

     * Apemantus. He wrought better that made the painter; and yet
       he's but a filthy piece of work. 240

     * Painter. You're a dog.

     * Apemantus. Thy mother's of my generation: what's she, if I be a
       dog?

     * Timon. Wilt dine with me, Apemantus?

     * Apemantus. No; I eat not lords.

     * Timon. An thou shouldst, thou 'ldst anger ladies. 245

     * Apemantus. O, they eat lords; so they come by great bellies.

     * Timon. That's a lascivious apprehension.

     * Apemantus. So thou apprehendest it: take it for thy labour.

     * Timon. How dost thou like this jewel, Apemantus?

     * Apemantus. Not so well as plain-dealing, which will not cost a 250
       man a doit.

     * Timon. What dost thou think 'tis worth?

     * Apemantus. Not worth my thinking. How now, poet!

     * Poet. How now, philosopher!

     * Apemantus. Thou liest. 255

     * Poet. Art not one?

     * Apemantus. Yes.

     * Poet. Then I lie not.

     * Apemantus. Art not a poet?

     * Poet. Yes. 260

     * Apemantus. Then thou liest: look in thy last work, where thou
       hast feigned him a worthy fellow.

     * Poet. That's not feigned; he is so.

     * Apemantus. Yes, he is worthy of thee, and to pay thee for thy
       labour: he that loves to be flattered is worthy o' 265
       the flatterer. Heavens, that I were a lord!

     * Timon. What wouldst do then, Apemantus?

     * Apemantus. E'en as Apemantus does now; hate a lord with my heart.

     * Timon. What, thyself?

     * Apemantus. Ay. 270

     * Timon. Wherefore?

     * Apemantus. That I had no angry wit to be a lord.
       Art not thou a merchant?

     * Merchant. Ay, Apemantus.

     * Apemantus. Traffic confound thee, if the gods will not! 275

     * Merchant. If traffic do it, the gods do it.

     * Apemantus. Traffic's thy god; and thy god confound thee!

   [Trumpet sounds. Enter a Messenger]
     * Timon. What trumpet's that?

     * Messenger. 'Tis Alcibiades, and some twenty horse, 280
       All of companionship.

     * Timon. Pray, entertain them; give them guide to us.
       [Exeunt some Attendants]
       You must needs dine with me: go not you hence
       Till I have thank'd you: when dinner's done, 285
       Show me this piece. I am joyful of your sights.
       [Enter ALCIBIADES, with the rest]
       Most welcome, sir!

     * Apemantus. So, so, there!
       Aches contract and starve your supple joints! 290
       That there should be small love 'mongst these
       sweet knaves,
       And all this courtesy! The strain of man's bred out
       Into baboon and monkey.

     * Alcibiades. Sir, you have saved my longing, and I feed 295
       Most hungerly on your sight.

     * Timon. Right welcome, sir!
       Ere we depart, we'll share a bounteous time
       In different pleasures. Pray you, let us in.

   [Exeunt all except APEMANTUS]

   [Enter two Lords]
     * First Lord. What time o' day is't, Apemantus?

     * Apemantus. Time to be honest.

     * First Lord. That time serves still.

     * Apemantus. The more accursed thou, that still omitt'st it. 305

     * Second Lord. Thou art going to Lord Timon's feast?

     * Apemantus. Ay, to see meat fill knaves and wine heat fools.

     * Second Lord. Fare thee well, fare thee well.

     * Apemantus. Thou art a fool to bid me farewell twice.

     * Second Lord. Why, Apemantus? 310

     * Apemantus. Shouldst have kept one to thyself, for I mean to
       give thee none.

     * First Lord. Hang thyself!

     * Apemantus. No, I will do nothing at thy bidding: make thy
       requests to thy friend. 315

     * Second Lord. Away, unpeaceable dog, or I'll spurn thee hence!

     * Apemantus. I will fly, like a dog, the heels o' the ass.

   [Exit]
     * First Lord. He's opposite to humanity. Come, shall we in,
       And taste Lord Timon's bounty? he outgoes 320
       The very heart of kindness.

     * Second Lord. He pours it out; Plutus, the god of gold,
       Is but his steward: no meed, but he repays
       Sevenfold above itself; no gift to him,
       But breeds the giver a return exceeding 325
       All use of quittance.

     * First Lord. The noblest mind he carries
       That ever govern'd man.

     * Second Lord. Long may he live in fortunes! Shall we in?

     * First Lord. I'll keep you company. 330

   [Exeunt]

   Act I, Scene 2

   A banqueting-room in Timon’s house.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   [Hautboys playing loud music. A great banquet] [p]served in; FLAVIUS
   and others attending; then enter [p]TIMON, ALCIBIADES, Lords, Senators,
   and VENTIDIUS. [p]Then comes, dropping, after all, APEMANTUS,
   [p]discontentedly, like himself]
     * Ventidius. Most honour'd Timon,
       It hath pleased the gods to remember my father's age,
       And call him to long peace.
       He is gone happy, and has left me rich: 340
       Then, as in grateful virtue I am bound
       To your free heart, I do return those talents,
       Doubled with thanks and service, from whose help
       I derived liberty.

     * Timon. O, by no means, 345
       Honest Ventidius; you mistake my love:
       I gave it freely ever; and there's none
       Can truly say he gives, if he receives:
       If our betters play at that game, we must not dare
       To imitate them; faults that are rich are fair. 350

     * Ventidius. A noble spirit!

     * Timon. Nay, my lords,
       [They all stand ceremoniously looking on TIMON]
       Ceremony was but devised at first
       To set a gloss on faint deeds, hollow welcomes, 355
       Recanting goodness, sorry ere 'tis shown;
       But where there is true friendship, there needs none.
       Pray, sit; more welcome are ye to my fortunes
       Than my fortunes to me.

   [They sit]
     * First Lord. My lord, we always have confess'd it.

     * Apemantus. Ho, ho, confess'd it! hang'd it, have you not?

     * Timon. O, Apemantus, you are welcome.

     * Apemantus. No;
       You shall not make me welcome: 365
       I come to have thee thrust me out of doors.

     * Timon. Fie, thou'rt a churl; ye've got a humour there
       Does not become a man: 'tis much to blame.
       They say, my lords, 'ira furor brevis est;' but yond
       man is ever angry. Go, let him have a table by 370
       himself, for he does neither affect company, nor is
       he fit for't, indeed.

     * Apemantus. Let me stay at thine apperil, Timon: I come to
       observe; I give thee warning on't.

     * Timon. I take no heed of thee; thou'rt an Athenian, 375
       therefore welcome: I myself would have no power;
       prithee, let my meat make thee silent.

     * Apemantus. I scorn thy meat; 'twould choke me, for I should
       ne'er flatter thee. O you gods, what a number of
       men eat Timon, and he sees 'em not! It grieves me 380
       to see so many dip their meat in one man's blood;
       and all the madness is, he cheers them up too.
       I wonder men dare trust themselves with men:
       Methinks they should invite them without knives;
       Good for their meat, and safer for their lives. 385
       There's much example for't; the fellow that sits
       next him now, parts bread with him, pledges the
       breath of him in a divided draught, is the readiest
       man to kill him: 't has been proved. If I were a
       huge man, I should fear to drink at meals; 390
       Lest they should spy my windpipe's dangerous notes:
       Great men should drink with harness on their throats.

     * Timon. My lord, in heart; and let the health go round.

     * Second Lord. Let it flow this way, my good lord.

     * Apemantus. Flow this way! A brave fellow! he keeps his tides 395
       well. Those healths will make thee and thy state
       look ill, Timon. Here's that which is too weak to
       be a sinner, honest water, which ne'er left man i' the mire:
       This and my food are equals; there's no odds:
       Feasts are too proud to give thanks to the gods. 400
       Apemantus' grace.
       Immortal gods, I crave no pelf;
       I pray for no man but myself:
       Grant I may never prove so fond,
       To trust man on his oath or bond; 405
       Or a harlot, for her weeping;
       Or a dog, that seems a-sleeping:
       Or a keeper with my freedom;
       Or my friends, if I should need 'em.
       Amen. So fall to't: 410
       Rich men sin, and I eat root.
       [Eats and drinks]
       Much good dich thy good heart, Apemantus!

     * Timon. Captain Alcibiades, your heart's in the field now.

     * Alcibiades. My heart is ever at your service, my lord. 415

     * Timon. You had rather be at a breakfast of enemies than a
       dinner of friends.

     * Alcibiades. So the were bleeding-new, my lord, there's no meat
       like 'em: I could wish my best friend at such a feast.

     * Apemantus. Would all those fatterers were thine enemies then, 420
       that then thou mightst kill 'em and bid me to 'em!

     * First Lord. Might we but have that happiness, my lord, that you
       would once use our hearts, whereby we might express
       some part of our zeals, we should think ourselves
       for ever perfect. 425

     * Timon. O, no doubt, my good friends, but the gods
       themselves have provided that I shall have much help
       from you: how had you been my friends else? why
       have you that charitable title from thousands, did
       not you chiefly belong to my heart? I have told 430
       more of you to myself than you can with modesty
       speak in your own behalf; and thus far I confirm
       you. O you gods, think I, what need we have any
       friends, if we should ne'er have need of 'em? they
       were the most needless creatures living, should we 435
       ne'er have use for 'em, and would most resemble
       sweet instruments hung up in cases that keep their
       sounds to themselves. Why, I have often wished
       myself poorer, that I might come nearer to you. We
       are born to do benefits: and what better or 440
       properer can we can our own than the riches of our
       friends? O, what a precious comfort 'tis, to have
       so many, like brothers, commanding one another's
       fortunes! O joy, e'en made away ere 't can be born!
       Mine eyes cannot hold out water, methinks: to 445
       forget their faults, I drink to you.

     * Apemantus. Thou weepest to make them drink, Timon.

     * Second Lord. Joy had the like conception in our eyes
       And at that instant like a babe sprung up.

     * Apemantus. Ho, ho! I laugh to think that babe a bastard. 450

     * Third Lord. I promise you, my lord, you moved me much.

     * Apemantus. Much!

   [Tucket, within]
     * Timon. What means that trump?
       [Enter a Servant] 455
       How now?

     * Servant. Please you, my lord, there are certain
       ladies most desirous of admittance.

     * Timon. Ladies! what are their wills?

     * Servant. There comes with them a forerunner, my lord, which 460
       bears that office, to signify their pleasures.

     * Timon. I pray, let them be admitted.

   [Enter Cupid]
     * Cupid. Hail to thee, worthy Timon, and to all
       That of his bounties taste! The five best senses 465
       Acknowledge thee their patron; and come freely
       To gratulate thy plenteous bosom: th' ear,
       Taste, touch and smell, pleased from thy tale rise;
       They only now come but to feast thine eyes.

     * Timon. They're welcome all; let 'em have kind admittance: 470
       Music, make their welcome!

   [Exit Cupid]
     * First Lord. You see, my lord, how ample you're beloved.
       [Music. Re-enter Cupid with a mask of Ladies]
       as Amazons, with lutes in their hands, 475
       dancing and playing]

     * Apemantus. Hoy-day, what a sweep of vanity comes this way!
       They dance! they are mad women.
       Like madness is the glory of this life.
       As this pomp shows to a little oil and root. 480
       We make ourselves fools, to disport ourselves;
       And spend our flatteries, to drink those men
       Upon whose age we void it up again,
       With poisonous spite and envy.
       Who lives that's not depraved or depraves? 485
       Who dies, that bears not one spurn to their graves
       Of their friends' gift?
       I should fear those that dance before me now
       Would one day stamp upon me: 't has been done;
       Men shut their doors against a setting sun. 490
       [The Lords rise from table, with much adoring of]
       TIMON; and to show their loves, each singles out an
       Amazon, and all dance, men with women, a lofty
       strain or two to the hautboys, and cease]

     * Timon. You have done our pleasures much grace, fair ladies, 495
       Set a fair fashion on our entertainment,
       Which was not half so beautiful and kind;
       You have added worth unto 't and lustre,
       And entertain'd me with mine own device;
       I am to thank you for 't. 500

     * First Lady. My lord, you take us even at the best.

     * Apemantus. 'Faith, for the worst is filthy; and would not hold
       taking, I doubt me.

     * Timon. Ladies, there is an idle banquet attends you:
       Please you to dispose yourselves. 505

     * All Ladies. Most thankfully, my lord.

   [Exeunt Cupid and Ladies]
     * Timon. Flavius.

     * Flavius. My lord?

     * Timon. The little casket bring me hither. 510

     * Flavius. Yes, my lord. More jewels yet!
       There is no crossing him in 's humour;
       [Aside]
       Else I should tell him,—well, i' faith I should,
       When all's spent, he 'ld be cross'd then, an he could. 515
       'Tis pity bounty had not eyes behind,
       That man might ne'er be wretched for his mind.

   [Exit]
     * First Lord. Where be our men?

     * Servant. Here, my lord, in readiness. 520

     * Second Lord. Our horses!

   [Re-enter FLAVIUS, with the casket]
     * Timon. O my friends,
       I have one word to say to you: look you, my good lord,
       I must entreat you, honour me so much 525
       As to advance this jewel; accept it and wear it,
       Kind my lord.

     * First Lord. I am so far already in your gifts,—

     * All. So are we all.

   [Enter a Servant]
     * Servant. My lord, there are certain nobles of the senate
       Newly alighted, and come to visit you.

     * Timon. They are fairly welcome.

     * Flavius. I beseech your honour,
       Vouchsafe me a word; it does concern you near. 535

     * Timon. Near! why then, another time I'll hear thee:
       I prithee, let's be provided to show them
       entertainment.

     * Flavius. [Aside] I scarce know how.

   [Enter a Second Servant]
     * Second Servant. May it please your honour, Lord Lucius,
       Out of his free love, hath presented to you
       Four milk-white horses, trapp'd in silver.

     * Timon. I shall accept them fairly; let the presents
       Be worthily entertain'd. 545
       [Enter a third Servant]
       How now! what news?

     * Third Servant. Please you, my lord, that honourable
       gentleman, Lord Lucullus, entreats your company
       to-morrow to hunt with him, and has sent your honour 550
       two brace of greyhounds.

     * Timon. I'll hunt with him; and let them be received,
       Not without fair reward.

     * Flavius. [Aside] What will this come to?
       He commands us to provide, and give great gifts, 555
       And all out of an empty coffer:
       Nor will he know his purse, or yield me this,
       To show him what a beggar his heart is,
       Being of no power to make his wishes good:
       His promises fly so beyond his state 560
       That what he speaks is all in debt; he owes
       For every word: he is so kind that he now
       Pays interest for 't; his land's put to their books.
       Well, would I were gently put out of office
       Before I were forced out! 565
       Happier is he that has no friend to feed
       Than such that do e'en enemies exceed.
       I bleed inwardly for my lord.

   [Exit]
     * Timon. You do yourselves 570
       Much wrong, you bate too much of your own merits:
       Here, my lord, a trifle of our love.

     * Second Lord. With more than common thanks I will receive it.

     * Third Lord. O, he's the very soul of bounty!

     * Timon. And now I remember, my lord, you gave 575
       Good words the other day of a bay courser
       I rode on: it is yours, because you liked it.

     * Second Lord. O, I beseech you, pardon me, my lord, in that.

     * Timon. You may take my word, my lord; I know, no man
       Can justly praise but what he does affect: 580
       I weigh my friend's affection with mine own;
       I'll tell you true. I'll call to you.

     * All Lords. O, none so welcome.

     * Timon. I take all and your several visitations
       So kind to heart, 'tis not enough to give; 585
       Methinks, I could deal kingdoms to my friends,
       And ne'er be weary. Alcibiades,
       Thou art a soldier, therefore seldom rich;
       It comes in charity to thee: for all thy living
       Is 'mongst the dead, and all the lands thou hast 590
       Lie in a pitch'd field.

     * Alcibiades. Ay, defiled land, my lord.

     * First Lord. We are so virtuously bound—

     * Timon. And so
       Am I to you. 595

     * Second Lord. So infinitely endear'd—

     * Timon. All to you. Lights, more lights!

     * First Lord. The best of happiness,
       Honour and fortunes, keep with you, Lord Timon!

     * Timon. Ready for his friends. 600

   [Exeunt all but APEMANTUS and TIMON]
     * Apemantus. What a coil's here!
       Serving of becks and jutting-out of bums!
       I doubt whether their legs be worth the sums
       That are given for 'em. Friendship's full of dregs: 605
       Methinks, false hearts should never have sound legs,
       Thus honest fools lay out their wealth on court'sies.

     * Timon. Now, Apemantus, if thou wert not sullen, I would be
       good to thee.

     * Apemantus. No, I'll nothing: for if I should be bribed too, 610
       there would be none left to rail upon thee, and then
       thou wouldst sin the faster. Thou givest so long,
       Timon, I fear me thou wilt give away thyself in
       paper shortly: what need these feasts, pomps and
       vain-glories? 615

     * Timon. Nay, an you begin to rail on society once, I am
       sworn not to give regard to you. Farewell; and come
       with better music.

   [Exit]
     * Apemantus. So: 620
       Thou wilt not hear me now; thou shalt not then:
       I'll lock thy heaven from thee.
       O, that men's ears should be
       To counsel deaf, but not to flattery!

   [Exit]

   Act II, Scene 1

   A Senator’s house.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   [Enter Senator, with papers in his hand]
     * Senator. And late, five thousand: to Varro and to Isidore
       He owes nine thousand; besides my former sum,
       Which makes it five and twenty. Still in motion
       Of raging waste? It cannot hold; it will not. 630
       If I want gold, steal but a beggar's dog,
       And give it Timon, why, the dog coins gold.
       If I would sell my horse, and buy twenty more
       Better than he, why, give my horse to Timon,
       Ask nothing, give it him, it foals me, straight, 635
       And able horses. No porter at his gate,
       But rather one that smiles and still invites
       All that pass by. It cannot hold: no reason
       Can found his state in safety. Caphis, ho!
       Caphis, I say! 640

   [Enter CAPHIS]
     * Caphis. Here, sir; what is your pleasure?

     * Senator. Get on your cloak, and haste you to Lord Timon;
       Importune him for my moneys; be not ceased
       With slight denial, nor then silenced when— 645
       'Commend me to your master'—and the cap
       Plays in the right hand, thus: but tell him,
       My uses cry to me, I must serve my turn
       Out of mine own; his days and times are past
       And my reliances on his fracted dates 650
       Have smit my credit: I love and honour him,
       But must not break my back to heal his finger;
       Immediate are my needs, and my relief
       Must not be toss'd and turn'd to me in words,
       But find supply immediate. Get you gone: 655
       Put on a most importunate aspect,
       A visage of demand; for, I do fear,
       When every feather sticks in his own wing,
       Lord Timon will be left a naked gull,
       Which flashes now a phoenix. Get you gone. 660

     * Caphis. I go, sir.

     * Senator. 'I go, sir!'—Take the bonds along with you,
       And have the dates in contempt.

     * Caphis. I will, sir.

     * Senator. Go. 665

   [Exeunt]

   Act II, Scene 2

   The same. A hall in Timon’s house.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   [Enter FLAVIUS, with many bills in his hand]
     * Flavius. No care, no stop! so senseless of expense,
       That he will neither know how to maintain it,
       Nor cease his flow of riot: takes no account 670
       How things go from him, nor resumes no care
       Of what is to continue: never mind
       Was to be so unwise, to be so kind.
       What shall be done? he will not hear, till feel:
       I must be round with him, now he comes from hunting. 675
       Fie, fie, fie, fie!

   [Enter CAPHIS, and the Servants of Isidore and Varro]
     * Caphis. Good even, Varro: what,
       You come for money?

     * Caphis. It is: and yours too, Isidore?

     * Caphis. Would we were all discharged!

     * Caphis. Here comes the lord. 685

   [Enter TIMON, ALCIBIADES, and Lords, &c]
     * Timon. So soon as dinner's done, we'll forth again,
       My Alcibiades. With me? what is your will?

     * Caphis. My lord, here is a note of certain dues.

     * Timon. Dues! Whence are you? 690

     * Caphis. Of Athens here, my lord.

     * Timon. Go to my steward.

     * Caphis. Please it your lordship, he hath put me off
       To the succession of new days this month:
       My master is awaked by great occasion 695
       To call upon his own, and humbly prays you
       That with your other noble parts you'll suit
       In giving him his right.

     * Timon. Mine honest friend,
       I prithee, but repair to me next morning. 700

     * Caphis. Nay, good my lord,—

     * Timon. Contain thyself, good friend.
       He humbly prays your speedy payment.

     * Caphis. If you did know, my lord, my master's wants—
       And I am sent expressly to your lordship.

     * Timon. Give me breath. 710
       I do beseech you, good my lords, keep on;
       I'll wait upon you instantly.
       [Exeunt ALCIBIADES and Lords]
       [To FLAVIUS]
       Come hither: pray you, 715
       How goes the world, that I am thus encounter'd
       With clamourous demands of date-broke bonds,
       And the detention of long-since-due debts,
       Against my honour?

     * Flavius. Please you, gentlemen, 720
       The time is unagreeable to this business:
       Your importunacy cease till after dinner,
       That I may make his lordship understand
       Wherefore you are not paid.

     * Timon. Do so, my friends. See them well entertain'd. 725

   [Exit]
     * Flavius. Pray, draw near.

   [Exit]

   [Enter APEMANTUS and Fool]
     * Caphis. Stay, stay, here comes the fool with Apemantus: 730
       let's ha' some sport with 'em.

     * Apemantus. Dost dialogue with thy shadow? 735

     * Apemantus. No,'tis to thyself.
       [To the Fool]
       Come away.

     * Apemantus. No, thou stand'st single, thou'rt not on him yet.

     * Caphis. Where's the fool now?

     * Apemantus. He last asked the question. Poor rogues, and
       usurers' men! bawds between gold and want!

     * All Servants. What are we, Apemantus? 745

     * Apemantus. Asses.

     * All Servants. Why?

     * Apemantus. That you ask me what you are, and do not know
       yourselves. Speak to 'em, fool.

     * Fool. How do you, gentlemen? 750

     * All Servants. Gramercies, good fool: how does your mistress?

     * Fool. She's e'en setting on water to scald such chickens
       as you are. Would we could see you at Corinth!

     * Apemantus. Good! gramercy.

   [Enter Page]
     * Fool. Look you, here comes my mistress' page.

     * Page. [To the Fool] Why, how now, captain! what do you
       in this wise company? How dost thou, Apemantus?

     * Apemantus. Would I had a rod in my mouth, that I might answer
       thee profitably. 760

     * Page. Prithee, Apemantus, read me the superscription of
       these letters: I know not which is which.

     * Apemantus. Canst not read?

     * Page. No.

     * Apemantus. There will little learning die then, that day thou 765
       art hanged. This is to Lord Timon; this to
       Alcibiades. Go; thou wast born a bastard, and thou't
       die a bawd.

     * Page. Thou wast whelped a dog, and thou shalt famish a
       dog's death. Answer not; I am gone. 770

   [Exit]
     * Apemantus. E'en so thou outrunnest grace. Fool, I will go with
       you to Lord Timon's.

     * Fool. Will you leave me there?

     * Apemantus. If Timon stay at home. You three serve three usurers?
       775

     * All Servants. Ay; would they served us!

     * Apemantus. So would I,—as good a trick as ever hangman served
       thief.

     * Fool. Are you three usurers' men?

     * All Servants. Ay, fool.

     * Fool. I think no usurer but has a fool to his servant: my 780
       mistress is one, and I am her fool. When men come
       to borrow of your masters, they approach sadly, and
       go away merry; but they enter my mistress' house
       merrily, and go away sadly: the reason of this?

     * Apemantus. Do it then, that we may account thee a whoremaster
       and a knave; which not-withstanding, thou shalt be
       no less esteemed.

     * Fool. A fool in good clothes, and something like thee. 790
       'Tis a spirit: sometime't appears like a lord;
       sometime like a lawyer; sometime like a philosopher,
       with two stones moe than's artificial one: he is
       very often like a knight; and, generally, in all
       shapes that man goes up and down in from fourscore 795
       to thirteen, this spirit walks in.

     * Fool. Nor thou altogether a wise man: as much foolery as
       I have, so much wit thou lackest.

     * Apemantus. That answer might have become Apemantus. 800

     * All Servants. Aside, aside; here comes Lord Timon.

   [Re-enter TIMON and FLAVIUS]
     * Apemantus. Come with me, fool, come.

     * Fool. I do not always follow lover, elder brother and
       woman; sometime the philosopher. 805

   [Exeunt APEMANTUS and Fool]
     * Flavius. Pray you, walk near: I'll speak with you anon.

   [Exeunt Servants]
     * Timon. You make me marvel: wherefore ere this time
       Had you not fully laid my state before me, 810
       That I might so have rated my expense,
       As I had leave of means?

     * Flavius. You would not hear me,
       At many leisures I proposed.

     * Timon. Go to: 815
       Perchance some single vantages you took.
       When my indisposition put you back:
       And that unaptness made your minister,
       Thus to excuse yourself.

     * Flavius. O my good lord, 820
       At many times I brought in my accounts,
       Laid them before you; you would throw them off,
       And say, you found them in mine honesty.
       When, for some trifling present, you have bid me
       Return so much, I have shook my head and wept; 825
       Yea, 'gainst the authority of manners, pray'd you
       To hold your hand more close: I did endure
       Not seldom, nor no slight cheques, when I have
       Prompted you in the ebb of your estate
       And your great flow of debts. My loved lord, 830
       Though you hear now, too late—yet now's a time—
       The greatest of your having lacks a half
       To pay your present debts.

     * Timon. Let all my land be sold.

     * Flavius. 'Tis all engaged, some forfeited and gone; 835
       And what remains will hardly stop the mouth
       Of present dues: the future comes apace:
       What shall defend the interim? and at length
       How goes our reckoning?

     * Timon. To Lacedaemon did my land extend. 840

     * Flavius. O my good lord, the world is but a word:
       Were it all yours to give it in a breath,
       How quickly were it gone!

     * Timon. You tell me true.

     * Flavius. If you suspect my husbandry or falsehood, 845
       Call me before the exactest auditors
       And set me on the proof. So the gods bless me,
       When all our offices have been oppress'd
       With riotous feeders, when our vaults have wept
       With drunken spilth of wine, when every room 850
       Hath blazed with lights and bray'd with minstrelsy,
       I have retired me to a wasteful cock,
       And set mine eyes at flow.

     * Timon. Prithee, no more.

     * Flavius. Heavens, have I said, the bounty of this lord! 855
       How many prodigal bits have slaves and peasants
       This night englutted! Who is not Timon's?
       What heart, head, sword, force, means, but is
       Lord Timon's?
       Great Timon, noble, worthy, royal Timon! 860
       Ah, when the means are gone that buy this praise,
       The breath is gone whereof this praise is made:
       Feast-won, fast-lost; one cloud of winter showers,
       These flies are couch'd.

     * Timon. Come, sermon me no further: 865
       No villanous bounty yet hath pass'd my heart;
       Unwisely, not ignobly, have I given.
       Why dost thou weep? Canst thou the conscience lack,
       To think I shall lack friends? Secure thy heart;
       If I would broach the vessels of my love, 870
       And try the argument of hearts by borrowing,
       Men and men's fortunes could I frankly use
       As I can bid thee speak.

     * Flavius. Assurance bless your thoughts!

     * Timon. And, in some sort, these wants of mine are crown'd, 875
       That I account them blessings; for by these
       Shall I try friends: you shall perceive how you
       Mistake my fortunes; I am wealthy in my friends.
       Within there! Flaminius! Servilius!

   [Enter FLAMINIUS, SERVILIUS, and other Servants]
     * All Servants. My lord? my lord?

     * Timon. I will dispatch you severally; you to Lord Lucius;
       to Lord Lucullus you: I hunted with his honour
       to-day: you, to Sempronius: commend me to their
       loves, and, I am proud, say, that my occasions have 885
       found time to use 'em toward a supply of money: let
       the request be fifty talents.

     * Flaminius. As you have said, my lord.

     * Flavius. [Aside] Lord Lucius and Lucullus? hum!

     * Timon. Go you, sir, to the senators— 890
       Of whom, even to the state's best health, I have
       Deserved this hearing—bid 'em send o' the instant
       A thousand talents to me.

     * Flavius. I have been bold—
       For that I knew it the most general way— 895
       To them to use your signet and your name;
       But they do shake their heads, and I am here
       No richer in return.

     * Timon. Is't true? can't be?

     * Flavius. They answer, in a joint and corporate voice, 900
       That now they are at fall, want treasure, cannot
       Do what they would; are sorry—you are honourable,—
       But yet they could have wish'd—they know not—
       Something hath been amiss—a noble nature
       May catch a wrench—would all were well—'tis pity;— 905
       And so, intending other serious matters,
       After distasteful looks and these hard fractions,
       With certain half-caps and cold-moving nods
       They froze me into silence.

     * Timon. You gods, reward them! 910
       Prithee, man, look cheerly. These old fellows
       Have their ingratitude in them hereditary:
       Their blood is caked, 'tis cold, it seldom flows;
       'Tis lack of kindly warmth they are not kind;
       And nature, as it grows again toward earth, 915
       Is fashion'd for the journey, dull and heavy.
       [To a Servant]
       Go to Ventidius.
       [To FLAVIUS]
       Prithee, be not sad, 920
       Thou art true and honest; ingeniously I speak.
       No blame belongs to thee.
       [To Servant]
       Ventidius lately
       Buried his father; by whose death he's stepp'd 925
       Into a great estate: when he was poor,
       Imprison'd and in scarcity of friends,
       I clear'd him with five talents: greet him from me;
       Bid him suppose some good necessity
       Touches his friend, which craves to be remember'd 930
       With those five talents.
       [Exit Servant]
       [To FLAVIUS]
       That had, give't these fellows
       To whom 'tis instant due. Ne'er speak, or think, 935
       That Timon's fortunes 'mong his friends can sink.

     * Flavius. I would I could not think it: that thought is
       bounty's foe;
       Being free itself, it thinks all others so.

   [Exeunt]

   Act III, Scene 1

   A room in Lucullus’ house.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   [FLAMINIUS waiting. Enter a Servant to him]
     * Servant. I have told my lord of you; he is coming down to you.

     * Flaminius. I thank you, sir.

   [Enter LUCULLUS]
     * Servant. Here's my lord. 945

     * Lucullus. [Aside] One of Lord Timon's men? a gift, I
       warrant. Why, this hits right; I dreamt of a silver
       basin and ewer to-night. Flaminius, honest
       Flaminius; you are very respectively welcome, sir.
       Fill me some wine. 950
       [Exit Servants]
       And how does that honourable, complete, free-hearted
       gentleman of Athens, thy very bountiful good lord
       and master?

     * Flaminius. His health is well sir. 955

     * Lucullus. I am right glad that his health is well, sir: and
       what hast thou there under thy cloak, pretty Flaminius?

     * Flaminius. 'Faith, nothing but an empty box, sir; which, in my
       lord's behalf, I come to entreat your honour to
       supply; who, having great and instant occasion to 960
       use fifty talents, hath sent to your lordship to
       furnish him, nothing doubting your present
       assistance therein.

     * Lucullus. La, la, la, la! 'nothing doubting,' says he? Alas,
       good lord! a noble gentleman 'tis, if he would not 965
       keep so good a house. Many a time and often I ha'
       dined with him, and told him on't, and come again to
       supper to him, of purpose to have him spend less,
       and yet he would embrace no counsel, take no warning
       by my coming. Every man has his fault, and honesty 970
       is his: I ha' told him on't, but I could ne'er get
       him from't.

   [Re-enter Servant, with wine]
     * Servant. Please your lordship, here is the wine.

     * Lucullus. Flaminius, I have noted thee always wise. Here's to thee.
       975

     * Flaminius. Your lordship speaks your pleasure.

     * Lucullus. I have observed thee always for a towardly prompt
       spirit—give thee thy due—and one that knows what
       belongs to reason; and canst use the time well, if
       the time use thee well: good parts in thee. 980
       [To Servant]
       Get you gone, sirrah.
       [Exit Servant]
       Draw nearer, honest Flaminius. Thy lord's a
       bountiful gentleman: but thou art wise; and thou 985
       knowest well enough, although thou comest to me,
       that this is no time to lend money, especially upon
       bare friendship, without security. Here's three
       solidares for thee: good boy, wink at me, and say
       thou sawest me not. Fare thee well. 990

     * Flaminius. Is't possible the world should so much differ,
       And we alive that lived? Fly, damned baseness,
       To him that worships thee!

   [Throwing the money back]
     * Lucullus. Ha! now I see thou art a fool, and fit for thy master.
       995

   [Exit]
     * Flaminius. May these add to the number that may scald thee!
       Let moulten coin be thy damnation,
       Thou disease of a friend, and not himself!
       Has friendship such a faint and milky heart, 1000
       It turns in less than two nights? O you gods,
       I feel master's passion! this slave,
       Unto his honour, has my lord's meat in him:
       Why should it thrive and turn to nutriment,
       When he is turn'd to poison? 1005
       O, may diseases only work upon't!
       And, when he's sick to death, let not that part of nature
       Which my lord paid for, be of any power
       To expel sickness, but prolong his hour!

   [Exit]
   _______________________________________________________________________



   Act III, Scene 2

   A public place.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   [Enter LUCILIUS, with three Strangers]
     * Lucilius. Who, the Lord Timon? he is my very good friend, and
       an honourable gentleman.

     * First Stranger. We know him for no less, though we are but
       strangers
       to him. But I can tell you one thing, my lord, and 1015
       which I hear from common rumours: now Lord Timon's
       happy hours are done and past, and his estate
       shrinks from him.

     * Lucilius. Fie, no, do not believe it; he cannot want for money.

     * Second Stranger. But believe you this, my lord, that, not long ago,
       1020
       one of his men was with the Lord Lucullus to borrow
       so many talents, nay, urged extremely for't and
       showed what necessity belonged to't, and yet was denied.

     * Lucilius. How!

     * Second Stranger. I tell you, denied, my lord. 1025

     * Lucilius. What a strange case was that! now, before the gods,
       I am ashamed on't. Denied that honourable man!
       there was very little honour showed in't. For my own
       part, I must needs confess, I have received some
       small kindnesses from him, as money, plate, jewels 1030
       and such-like trifles, nothing comparing to his;
       yet, had he mistook him and sent to me, I should
       ne'er have denied his occasion so many talents.

   [Enter SERVILIUS]
     * Servilius. See, by good hap, yonder's my lord; 1035
       I have sweat to see his honour. My honoured lord,—

   [To LUCIUS]
     * Lucilius. Servilius! you are kindly met, sir. Fare thee well:
       commend me to thy honourable virtuous lord, my very
       exquisite friend. 1040

     * Servilius. May it please your honour, my lord hath sent—

     * Lucilius. Ha! what has he sent? I am so much endeared to
       that lord; he's ever sending: how shall I thank
       him, thinkest thou? And what has he sent now?

     * Servilius. Has only sent his present occasion now, my lord; 1045
       requesting your lordship to supply his instant use
       with so many talents.

     * Lucilius. I know his lordship is but merry with me;
       He cannot want fifty five hundred talents.

     * Servilius. But in the mean time he wants less, my lord. 1050
       If his occasion were not virtuous,
       I should not urge it half so faithfully.

     * Lucilius. Dost thou speak seriously, Servilius?

     * Servilius. Upon my soul,'tis true, sir.

     * Lucilius. What a wicked beast was I to disfurnish myself 1055
       against such a good time, when I might ha' shown
       myself honourable! how unluckily it happened, that I
       should purchase the day before for a little part,
       and undo a great deal of honoured! Servilius, now,
       before the gods, I am not able to do,—the more 1060
       beast, I say:—I was sending to use Lord Timon
       myself, these gentlemen can witness! but I would
       not, for the wealth of Athens, I had done't now.
       Commend me bountifully to his good lordship; and I
       hope his honour will conceive the fairest of me, 1065
       because I have no power to be kind: and tell him
       this from me, I count it one of my greatest
       afflictions, say, that I cannot pleasure such an
       honourable gentleman. Good Servilius, will you
       befriend me so far, as to use mine own words to him? 1070

     * Servilius. Yes, sir, I shall.

     * Lucilius. I'll look you out a good turn, Servilius.
       [Exit SERVILIUS]
       True as you said, Timon is shrunk indeed;
       And he that's once denied will hardly speed. 1075

   [Exit]
     * First Stranger. Do you observe this, Hostilius?

     * Second Stranger. Ay, too well.

     * First Stranger. Why, this is the world's soul; and just of the
       same piece 1080
       Is every flatterer's spirit. Who can call him
       His friend that dips in the same dish? for, in
       My knowing, Timon has been this lord's father,
       And kept his credit with his purse,
       Supported his estate; nay, Timon's money 1085
       Has paid his men their wages: he ne'er drinks,
       But Timon's silver treads upon his lip;
       And yet—O, see the monstrousness of man
       When he looks out in an ungrateful shape!—
       He does deny him, in respect of his, 1090
       What charitable men afford to beggars.

     * Third Stranger. Religion groans at it.

     * First Stranger. For mine own part,
       I never tasted Timon in my life,
       Nor came any of his bounties over me, 1095
       To mark me for his friend; yet, I protest,
       For his right noble mind, illustrious virtue
       And honourable carriage,
       Had his necessity made use of me,
       I would have put my wealth into donation, 1100
       And the best half should have return'd to him,
       So much I love his heart: but, I perceive,
       Men must learn now with pity to dispense;
       For policy sits above conscience.

   [Exeunt]

   Act III, Scene 3

   A room in Sempronius’ house.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   [Enter SEMPRONIUS, and a Servant of TIMON's]
     * Sempronius. Must he needs trouble me in 't,—hum!—'bove
       all others?
       He might have tried Lord Lucius or Lucullus;
       And now Ventidius is wealthy too, 1110
       Whom he redeem'd from prison: all these
       Owe their estates unto him.

     * Servant. My lord,
       They have all been touch'd and found base metal, for
       They have au denied him. 1115

     * Sempronius. How! have they denied him?
       Has Ventidius and Lucullus denied him?
       And does he send to me? Three? hum!
       It shows but little love or judgment in him:
       Must I be his last refuge! His friends, like 1120
       physicians,
       Thrive, give him over: must I take the cure upon me?
       Has much disgraced me in't; I'm angry at him,
       That might have known my place: I see no sense for't,
       But his occasion might have woo'd me first; 1125
       For, in my conscience, I was the first man
       That e'er received gift from him:
       And does he think so backwardly of me now,
       That I'll requite its last? No:
       So it may prove an argument of laughter 1130
       To the rest, and 'mongst lords I be thought a fool.
       I'ld rather than the worth of thrice the sum,
       Had sent to me first, but for my mind's sake;
       I'd such a courage to do him good. But now return,
       And with their faint reply this answer join; 1135
       Who bates mine honour shall not know my coin.

   [Exit]
     * Servant. Excellent! Your lordship's a goodly villain. The
       devil knew not what he did when he made man
       politic; he crossed himself by 't: and I cannot 1140
       think but, in the end, the villainies of man will
       set him clear. How fairly this lord strives to
       appear foul! takes virtuous copies to be wicked,
       like those that under hot ardent zeal would set
       whole realms on fire: Of such a nature is his 1145
       politic love.
       This was my lord's best hope; now all are fled,
       Save only the gods: now his friends are dead,
       Doors, that were ne'er acquainted with their wards
       Many a bounteous year must be employ'd 1150
       Now to guard sure their master.
       And this is all a liberal course allows;
       Who cannot keep his wealth must keep his house.

   [Exit]

   Act III, Scene 4

   The same. A hall in Timon’s house.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   [Enter two Servants of Varro, and the Servant of] [p]LUCIUS, meeting
   TITUS, HORTENSIUS, and other [p]Servants of TIMON's creditors, waiting
   his coming out]
     * First Servant. Well met; good morrow, Titus and Hortensius.

     * Titus. The like to you kind Varro. 1160

     * Hortensius. Lucius!
       What, do we meet together?
       One business does command us all; for mine Is money.

     * Titus. So is theirs and ours. 1165

   [Enter PHILOTUS]
     * Philotus. Good day at once.
       What do you think the hour?

     * Philotus. Labouring for nine.

     * Philotus. Is not my lord seen yet?

     * Philotus. I wonder on't; he was wont to shine at seven. 1175
       You must consider that a prodigal course
       Is like the sun's; but not, like his, recoverable.
       I fear 'tis deepest winter in Lord Timon's purse;
       That is one may reach deep enough, and yet
       Find little. 1180

     * Philotus. I am of your fear for that.

     * Titus. I'll show you how to observe a strange event.
       Your lord sends now for money.

     * Hortensius. Most true, he does. 1185

     * Titus. And he wears jewels now of Timon's gift,
       For which I wait for money.

     * Hortensius. It is against my heart.
       Timon in this should pay more than he owes:
       And e'en as if your lord should wear rich jewels, 1190
       And send for money for 'em.

     * Hortensius. I'm weary of this charge, the gods can witness:
       I know my lord hath spent of Timon's wealth,
       And now ingratitude makes it worse than stealth. 1195

     * First Servant. Yes, mine's three thousand crowns: what's yours?

     * First Servant. 'Tis much deep: and it should seem by the sun, 1200
       Your master's confidence was above mine;
       Else, surely, his had equall'd.
       Enter Flaminius.

     * Titus. One of Lord Timon's men.
       come forth? 1205

     * Flaminius. No, indeed, he is not.

     * Titus. We attend his lordship; pray, signify so much.

     * Flaminius. I need not tell him that; he knows you are too diligent.

   [Exit]

   [Enter FLAVIUS in a cloak, muffled] [p]He goes away in a cloud: call
   him, call him.
     * Titus. Do you hear, sir?

     * Second Servant. By your leave, sir,—

     * Flavius. What do ye ask of me, my friend?

     * Titus. We wait for certain money here, sir.

     * Flavius. Ay,
       If money were as certain as your waiting, 1220
       'Twere sure enough.
       Why then preferr'd you not your sums and bills,
       When your false masters eat of my lord's meat?
       Then they could smile and fawn upon his debts
       And take down the interest into their 1225
       gluttonous maws.
       You do yourselves but wrong to stir me up;
       Let me pass quietly:
       Believe 't, my lord and I have made an end;
       I have no more to reckon, he to spend. 1230

     * Flavius. If 'twill not serve,'tis not so base as you;
       For you serve knaves.

   [Exit]
     * First Servant. How! what does his cashiered worship mutter?

     * Second Servant. No matter what; he's poor, and that's revenge
       enough. Who can speak broader than he that has no
       house to put his head in? such may rail against 1240
       great buildings.

   [Enter SERVILIUS]
     * Titus. O, here's Servilius; now we shall know some answer.

     * Servilius. If I might beseech you, gentlemen, to repair some
       other hour, I should derive much from't; for, 1245
       take't of my soul, my lord leans wondrously to
       discontent: his comfortable temper has forsook him;
       he's much out of health, and keeps his chamber.
       And, if it be so far beyond his health,
       Methinks he should the sooner pay his debts, 1250
       And make a clear way to the gods.

     * Servilius. Good gods!

     * Titus. We cannot take this for answer, sir.

     * Flaminius. [Within] Servilius, help! My lord! my lord! 1255

   [Enter TIMON, in a rage, FLAMINIUS following]
     * Timon. What, are my doors opposed against my passage?
       Have I been ever free, and must my house
       Be my retentive enemy, my gaol?
       The place which I have feasted, does it now, 1260
       Like all mankind, show me an iron heart?

     * Titus. My lord, here is my bill.

     * Hortensius. And mine, my lord. 1265

     * Philotus. All our bills.

     * Timon. Knock me down with 'em: cleave me to the girdle.

     * Timon. Cut my heart in sums.

     * Titus. Mine, fifty talents.

     * Timon. Tell out my blood.

     * Timon. Five thousand drops pays that. 1275
       What yours?—and yours?

     * First Servant. My lord,—

     * Second Servant. My lord,— 1280

     * Timon. Tear me, take me, and the gods fall upon you!

   [Exit]
     * Hortensius. 'Faith, I perceive our masters may throw their caps
       at their money: these debts may well be called
       desperate ones, for a madman owes 'em. 1285

   [Exeunt]

   [Re-enter TIMON and FLAVIUS]
     * Timon. They have e'en put my breath from me, the slaves.
       Creditors? devils!

     * Flavius. My dear lord,— 1290

     * Timon. What if it should be so?

     * Flavius. My lord,—

     * Timon. I'll have it so. My steward!

     * Flavius. Here, my lord.

     * Timon. So fitly? Go, bid all my friends again, 1295
       Lucius, Lucullus, and Sempronius:
       All, sirrah, all:
       I'll once more feast the rascals.

     * Flavius. O my lord,
       You only speak from your distracted soul; 1300
       There is not so much left, to furnish out
       A moderate table.

     * Timon. Be't not in thy care; go,
       I charge thee, invite them all: let in the tide
       Of knaves once more; my cook and I'll provide. 1305

   [Exeunt]

     * First Senator. My lord, you have my voice to it; the fault's
       Bloody; 'tis necessary he should die:
       Nothing emboldens sin so much as mercy.

     * Second Senator. Most true; the law shall bruise him. 1310

   [Enter ALCIBIADES, with Attendants]
     * Alcibiades. Honour, health, and compassion to the senate!

     * First Senator. Now, captain?

     * Alcibiades. I am an humble suitor to your virtues;
       For pity is the virtue of the law, 1315
       And none but tyrants use it cruelly.
       It pleases time and fortune to lie heavy
       Upon a friend of mine, who, in hot blood,
       Hath stepp'd into the law, which is past depth
       To those that, without heed, do plunge into 't. 1320
       He is a man, setting his fate aside,
       Of comely virtues:
       Nor did he soil the fact with cowardice—
       An honour in him which buys out his fault—
       But with a noble fury and fair spirit, 1325
       Seeing his reputation touch'd to death,
       He did oppose his foe:
       And with such sober and unnoted passion
       He did behave his anger, ere 'twas spent,
       As if he had but proved an argument. 1330

     * First Senator. You undergo too strict a paradox,
       Striving to make an ugly deed look fair:
       Your words have took such pains as if they labour'd
       To bring manslaughter into form and set quarrelling
       Upon the head of valour; which indeed 1335
       Is valour misbegot and came into the world
       When sects and factions were newly born:
       He's truly valiant that can wisely suffer
       The worst that man can breathe, and make his wrongs
       His outsides, to wear them like his raiment, 1340
       carelessly,
       And ne'er prefer his injuries to his heart,
       To bring it into danger.
       If wrongs be evils and enforce us kill,
       What folly 'tis to hazard life for ill! 1345

     * Alcibiades. My lord,—

     * First Senator. You cannot make gross sins look clear:
       To revenge is no valour, but to bear.

     * Alcibiades. My lords, then, under favour, pardon me,
       If I speak like a captain. 1350
       Why do fond men expose themselves to battle,
       And not endure all threats? sleep upon't,
       And let the foes quietly cut their throats,
       Without repugnancy? If there be
       Such valour in the bearing, what make we 1355
       Abroad? why then, women are more valiant
       That stay at home, if bearing carry it,
       And the ass more captain than the lion, the felon
       Loaden with irons wiser than the judge,
       If wisdom be in suffering. O my lords, 1360
       As you are great, be pitifully good:
       Who cannot condemn rashness in cold blood?
       To kill, I grant, is sin's extremest gust;
       But, in defence, by mercy, 'tis most just.
       To be in anger is impiety; 1365
       But who is man that is not angry?
       Weigh but the crime with this.

     * Second Senator. You breathe in vain.

     * Alcibiades. In vain! his service done
       At Lacedaemon and Byzantium 1370
       Were a sufficient briber for his life.

     * First Senator. What's that?

     * Alcibiades. I say, my lords, he has done fair service,
       And slain in fight many of your enemies:
       How full of valour did he bear himself 1375
       In the last conflict, and made plenteous wounds!

     * Second Senator. He has made too much plenty with 'em;
       He's a sworn rioter: he has a sin that often
       Drowns him, and takes his valour prisoner:
       If there were no foes, that were enough 1380
       To overcome him: in that beastly fury
       He has been known to commit outrages,
       And cherish factions: 'tis inferr'd to us,
       His days are foul and his drink dangerous.

     * First Senator. He dies. 1385

     * Alcibiades. Hard fate! he might have died in war.
       My lords, if not for any parts in him—
       Though his right arm might purchase his own time
       And be in debt to none—yet, more to move you,
       Take my deserts to his, and join 'em both: 1390
       And, for I know your reverend ages love
       Security, I'll pawn my victories, all
       My honours to you, upon his good returns.
       If by this crime he owes the law his life,
       Why, let the war receive 't in valiant gore 1395
       For law is strict, and war is nothing more.

     * First Senator. We are for law: he dies; urge it no more,
       On height of our displeasure: friend or brother,
       He forfeits his own blood that spills another.

     * Alcibiades. Must it be so? it must not be. My lords, 1400
       I do beseech you, know me.

     * Second Senator. How!

     * Alcibiades. Call me to your remembrances.

     * Third Senator. What!

     * Alcibiades. I cannot think but your age has forgot me; 1405
       It could not else be, I should prove so base,
       To sue, and be denied such common grace:
       My wounds ache at you.

     * First Senator. Do you dare our anger?
       'Tis in few words, but spacious in effect; 1410
       We banish thee for ever.

     * Alcibiades. Banish me!
       Banish your dotage; banish usury,
       That makes the senate ugly.

     * First Senator. If, after two days' shine, Athens contain thee, 1415
       Attend our weightier judgment. And, not to swell
       our spirit,
       He shall be executed presently.

   [Exeunt Senators]
     * Alcibiades. Now the gods keep you old enough; that you may live
       1420
       Only in bone, that none may look on you!
       I'm worse than mad: I have kept back their foes,
       While they have told their money and let out
       Their coin upon large interest, I myself
       Rich only in large hurts. All those for this? 1425
       Is this the balsam that the usuring senate
       Pours into captains' wounds? Banishment!
       It comes not ill; I hate not to be banish'd;
       It is a cause worthy my spleen and fury,
       That I may strike at Athens. I'll cheer up 1430
       My discontented troops, and lay for hearts.
       'Tis honour with most lands to be at odds;
       Soldiers should brook as little wrongs as gods.

   [Exit]

   Act III, Scene 6

   The same. A banqueting-room in Timon’s house.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   [Music. Tables set out: Servants attending.] [p]Enter divers Lords,
   Senators and others, at [p]several doors]
     * First Lord. The good time of day to you, sir.

     * Second Lord. I also wish it to you. I think this honourable lord
       did but try us this other day. 1440

     * First Lord. Upon that were my thoughts tiring, when we
       encountered: I hope it is not so low with him as
       he made it seem in the trial of his several friends.

     * Second Lord. It should not be, by the persuasion of his new
       feasting.

     * First Lord. I should think so: he hath sent me an earnest 1445
       inviting, which many my near occasions did urge me
       to put off; but he hath conjured me beyond them, and
       I must needs appear.

     * Second Lord. In like manner was I in debt to my importunate
       business, but he would not hear my excuse. I am 1450
       sorry, when he sent to borrow of me, that my
       provision was out.

     * First Lord. I am sick of that grief too, as I understand how all
       things go.

     * Second Lord. Every man here's so. What would he have borrowed of
       1455
       you?

     * First Lord. A thousand pieces.

     * Second Lord. A thousand pieces!

     * First Lord. What of you?

     * Second Lord. He sent to me, sir,—Here he comes. 1460

   [Enter TIMON and Attendants]
     * Timon. With all my heart, gentlemen both; and how fare you?

     * First Lord. Ever at the best, hearing well of your lordship.

     * Second Lord. The swallow follows not summer more willing than we
       your lordship. 1465

     * Timon. [Aside] Nor more willingly leaves winter; such
       summer-birds are men. Gentlemen, our dinner will not
       recompense this long stay: feast your ears with the
       music awhile, if they will fare so harshly o' the
       trumpet's sound; we shall to 't presently. 1470

     * First Lord. I hope it remains not unkindly with your lordship
       that I returned you an empty messenger.

     * Timon. O, sir, let it not trouble you.

     * Second Lord. My noble lord,—

     * Timon. Ah, my good friend, what cheer? 1475

     * Second Lord. My most honourable lord, I am e'en sick of shame,
       that, when your lordship this other day sent to me,
       I was so unfortunate a beggar.

     * Timon. Think not on 't, sir.

     * Second Lord. If you had sent but two hours before,— 1480

     * Timon. Let it not cumber your better remembrance.
       [The banquet brought in]
       Come, bring in all together.

     * Second Lord. All covered dishes!

     * First Lord. Royal cheer, I warrant you. 1485

     * Third Lord. Doubt not that, if money and the season can yield
       it.

     * First Lord. How do you? What's the news?

     * Third Lord. Alcibiades is banished: hear you of it?

     * First Lord. [with Second Lord] Alcibiades banished! 1490

     * Third Lord. 'Tis so, be sure of it.

     * First Lord. How! how!

     * Second Lord. I pray you, upon what?

     * Timon. My worthy friends, will you draw near?

     * Third Lord. I'll tell you more anon. Here's a noble feast toward.
       1495

     * Second Lord. This is the old man still.

     * Third Lord. Will 't hold? will 't hold?

     * Second Lord. It does: but time will—and so—

     * Third Lord. I do conceive.

     * Timon. Each man to his stool, with that spur as he would to 1500
       the lip of his mistress: your diet shall be in all
       places alike. Make not a city feast of it, to let
       the meat cool ere we can agree upon the first place:
       sit, sit. The gods require our thanks.
       You great benefactors, sprinkle our society with 1505
       thankfulness. For your own gifts, make yourselves
       praised: but reserve still to give, lest your
       deities be despised. Lend to each man enough, that
       one need not lend to another; for, were your
       godheads to borrow of men, men would forsake the 1510
       gods. Make the meat be beloved more than the man
       that gives it. Let no assembly of twenty be without
       a score of villains: if there sit twelve women at
       the table, let a dozen of them be—as they are. The
       rest of your fees, O gods—the senators of Athens, 1515
       together with the common lag of people—what is
       amiss in them, you gods, make suitable for
       destruction. For these my present friends, as they
       are to me nothing, so in nothing bless them, and to
       nothing are they welcome. 1520
       Uncover, dogs, and lap.
       [The dishes are uncovered and seen to be full of]
       warm water]

     * Some Speak. What does his lordship mean?

     * Some Others. I know not. 1525

     * Timon. May you a better feast never behold,
       You knot of mouth-friends I smoke and lukewarm water
       Is your perfection. This is Timon's last;
       Who, stuck and spangled with your flatteries,
       Washes it off, and sprinkles in your faces 1530
       Your reeking villany.
       [Throwing the water in their faces]
       Live loathed and long,
       Most smiling, smooth, detested parasites,
       Courteous destroyers, affable wolves, meek bears, 1535
       You fools of fortune, trencher-friends, time's flies,
       Cap and knee slaves, vapours, and minute-jacks!
       Of man and beast the infinite malady
       Crust you quite o'er! What, dost thou go?
       Soft! take thy physic first—thou too—and thou;— 1540
       Stay, I will lend thee money, borrow none.
       [Throws the dishes at them, and drives them out]
       What, all in motion? Henceforth be no feast,
       Whereat a villain's not a welcome guest.
       Burn, house! sink, Athens! henceforth hated be 1545
       Of Timon man and all humanity!

   [Exit]

   [Re-enter the Lords, Senators, &c]
     * First Lord. How now, my lords!

     * Second Lord. Know you the quality of Lord Timon's fury? 1550

     * Third Lord. Push! did you see my cap?

     * Fourth Lord. I have lost my gown.

     * First Lord. He's but a mad lord, and nought but humour sways him.
       He gave me a jewel th' other day, and now he has
       beat it out of my hat: did you see my jewel? 1555

     * Third Lord. Did you see my cap?

     * Second Lord. Here 'tis.

     * Fourth Lord. Here lies my gown.

     * First Lord. Let's make no stay.

     * Second Lord. Lord Timon's mad. 1560

     * Third Lord. I feel 't upon my bones.

     * Fourth Lord. One day he gives us diamonds, next day stones.

   [Exeunt]

   Act IV, Scene 1

   Without the walls of Athens.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   [Enter TIMON]
     * Timon. Let me look back upon thee. O thou wall, 1565
       That girdlest in those wolves, dive in the earth,
       And fence not Athens! Matrons, turn incontinent!
       Obedience fail in children! slaves and fools,
       Pluck the grave wrinkled senate from the bench,
       And minister in their steads! to general filths 1570
       Convert o' the instant, green virginity,
       Do 't in your parents' eyes! bankrupts, hold fast;
       Rather than render back, out with your knives,
       And cut your trusters' throats! bound servants, steal!
       Large-handed robbers your grave masters are, 1575
       And pill by law. Maid, to thy master's bed;
       Thy mistress is o' the brothel! Son of sixteen,
       pluck the lined crutch from thy old limping sire,
       With it beat out his brains! Piety, and fear,
       Religion to the gods, peace, justice, truth, 1580
       Domestic awe, night-rest, and neighbourhood,
       Instruction, manners, mysteries, and trades,
       Degrees, observances, customs, and laws,
       Decline to your confounding contraries,
       And let confusion live! Plagues, incident to men, 1585
       Your potent and infectious fevers heap
       On Athens, ripe for stroke! Thou cold sciatica,
       Cripple our senators, that their limbs may halt
       As lamely as their manners. Lust and liberty
       Creep in the minds and marrows of our youth, 1590
       That 'gainst the stream of virtue they may strive,
       And drown themselves in riot! Itches, blains,
       Sow all the Athenian bosoms; and their crop
       Be general leprosy! Breath infect breath,
       at their society, as their friendship, may 1595
       merely poison! Nothing I'll bear from thee,
       But nakedness, thou detestable town!
       Take thou that too, with multiplying bans!
       Timon will to the woods; where he shall find
       The unkindest beast more kinder than mankind. 1600
       The gods confound—hear me, you good gods all—
       The Athenians both within and out that wall!
       And grant, as Timon grows, his hate may grow
       To the whole race of mankind, high and low! Amen.

   [Exit]
   _______________________________________________________________________



   Act IV, Scene 2

   Athens. A room in Timon’s house.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   [Enter FLAVIUS, with two or three Servants]
     * First Servant. Hear you, master steward, where's our master?
       Are we undone? cast off? nothing remaining?

     * Flavius. Alack, my fellows, what should I say to you?
       Let me be recorded by the righteous gods, 1610
       I am as poor as you.

     * First Servant. Such a house broke!
       So noble a master fall'n! All gone! and not
       One friend to take his fortune by the arm,
       And go along with him! 1615

     * Second Servant. As we do turn our backs
       From our companion thrown into his grave,
       So his familiars to his buried fortunes
       Slink all away, leave their false vows with him,
       Like empty purses pick'd; and his poor self, 1620
       A dedicated beggar to the air,
       With his disease of all-shunn'd poverty,
       Walks, like contempt, alone. More of our fellows.

   [Enter other Servants]
     * Flavius. All broken implements of a ruin'd house. 1625

     * Third Servant. Yet do our hearts wear Timon's livery;
       That see I by our faces; we are fellows still,
       Serving alike in sorrow: leak'd is our bark,
       And we, poor mates, stand on the dying deck,
       Hearing the surges threat: we must all part 1630
       Into this sea of air.

     * Flavius. Good fellows all,
       The latest of my wealth I'll share amongst you.
       Wherever we shall meet, for Timon's sake,
       Let's yet be fellows; let's shake our heads, and say, 1635
       As 'twere a knell unto our master's fortunes,
       'We have seen better days.' Let each take some;
       Nay, put out all your hands. Not one word more:
       Thus part we rich in sorrow, parting poor.
       [Servants embrace, and part several ways] 1640
       O, the fierce wretchedness that glory brings us!
       Who would not wish to be from wealth exempt,
       Since riches point to misery and contempt?
       Who would be so mock'd with glory? or to live
       But in a dream of friendship? 1645
       To have his pomp and all what state compounds
       But only painted, like his varnish'd friends?
       Poor honest lord, brought low by his own heart,
       Undone by goodness! Strange, unusual blood,
       When man's worst sin is, he does too much good! 1650
       Who, then, dares to be half so kind again?
       For bounty, that makes gods, does still mar men.
       My dearest lord, bless'd, to be most accursed,
       Rich, only to be wretched, thy great fortunes
       Are made thy chief afflictions. Alas, kind lord! 1655
       He's flung in rage from this ingrateful seat
       Of monstrous friends, nor has he with him to
       Supply his life, or that which can command it.
       I'll follow and inquire him out:
       I'll ever serve his mind with my best will; 1660
       Whilst I have gold, I'll be his steward still.

   [Exit]

   Act IV, Scene 3

   Woods and cave, near the seashore.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   [Enter TIMON, from the cave]
     * Timon. O blessed breeding sun, draw from the earth
       Rotten humidity; below thy sister's orb 1665
       Infect the air! Twinn'd brothers of one womb,
       Whose procreation, residence, and birth,
       Scarce is dividant, touch them with several fortunes;
       The greater scorns the lesser: not nature,
       To whom all sores lay siege, can bear great fortune, 1670
       But by contempt of nature.
       Raise me this beggar, and deny 't that lord;
       The senator shall bear contempt hereditary,
       The beggar native honour.
       It is the pasture lards the rother's sides, 1675
       The want that makes him lean. Who dares, who dares,
       In purity of manhood stand upright,
       And say 'This man's a flatterer?' if one be,
       So are they all; for every grise of fortune
       Is smooth'd by that below: the learned pate 1680
       Ducks to the golden fool: all is oblique;
       There's nothing level in our cursed natures,
       But direct villany. Therefore, be abhorr'd
       All feasts, societies, and throngs of men!
       His semblable, yea, himself, Timon disdains: 1685
       Destruction fang mankind! Earth, yield me roots!
       [Digging]
       Who seeks for better of thee, sauce his palate
       With thy most operant poison! What is here?
       Gold? yellow, glittering, precious gold? No, gods, 1690
       I am no idle votarist: roots, you clear heavens!
       Thus much of this will make black white, foul fair,
       Wrong right, base noble, old young, coward valiant.
       Ha, you gods! why this? what this, you gods? Why, this
       Will lug your priests and servants from your sides, 1695
       Pluck stout men's pillows from below their heads:
       This yellow slave
       Will knit and break religions, bless the accursed,
       Make the hoar leprosy adored, place thieves
       And give them title, knee and approbation 1700
       With senators on the bench: this is it
       That makes the wappen'd widow wed again;
       She, whom the spital-house and ulcerous sores
       Would cast the gorge at, this embalms and spices
       To the April day again. Come, damned earth, 1705
       Thou common whore of mankind, that put'st odds
       Among the route of nations, I will make thee
       Do thy right nature.
       [March afar off]
       Ha! a drum? Thou'rt quick, 1710
       But yet I'll bury thee: thou'lt go, strong thief,
       When gouty keepers of thee cannot stand.
       Nay, stay thou out for earnest.
       [Keeping some gold]
       [Enter ALCIBIADES, with drum and fife, in] 1715
       warlike manner; PHRYNIA and TIMANDRA]

     * Alcibiades. What art thou there? speak.

     * Timon. A beast, as thou art. The canker gnaw thy heart,
       For showing me again the eyes of man!

     * Alcibiades. What is thy name? Is man so hateful to thee, 1720
       That art thyself a man?

     * Timon. I am Misanthropos, and hate mankind.
       For thy part, I do wish thou wert a dog,
       That I might love thee something.

     * Alcibiades. I know thee well; 1725
       But in thy fortunes am unlearn'd and strange.

     * Timon. I know thee too; and more than that I know thee,
       I not desire to know. Follow thy drum;
       With man's blood paint the ground, gules, gules:
       Religious canons, civil laws are cruel; 1730
       Then what should war be? This fell whore of thine
       Hath in her more destruction than thy sword,
       For all her cherubim look.

     * Phrynia. Thy lips rot off!

     * Timon. I will not kiss thee; then the rot returns 1735
       To thine own lips again.

     * Alcibiades. How came the noble Timon to this change?

     * Timon. As the moon does, by wanting light to give:
       But then renew I could not, like the moon;
       There were no suns to borrow of. 1740

     * Alcibiades. Noble Timon,
       What friendship may I do thee?

     * Timon. None, but to
       Maintain my opinion.

     * Alcibiades. What is it, Timon? 1745

     * Timon. Promise me friendship, but perform none: if thou
       wilt not promise, the gods plague thee, for thou art
       a man! if thou dost perform, confound thee, for
       thou art a man!

     * Alcibiades. I have heard in some sort of thy miseries. 1750

     * Timon. Thou saw'st them, when I had prosperity.

     * Alcibiades. I see them now; then was a blessed time.

     * Timon. As thine is now, held with a brace of harlots.

     * Timandra. Is this the Athenian minion, whom the world
       Voiced so regardfully? 1755

     * Timon. Art thou Timandra?

     * Timandra. Yes.

     * Timon. Be a whore still: they love thee not that use thee;
       Give them diseases, leaving with thee their lust.
       Make use of thy salt hours: season the slaves 1760
       For tubs and baths; bring down rose-cheeked youth
       To the tub-fast and the diet.

     * Timandra. Hang thee, monster!

     * Alcibiades. Pardon him, sweet Timandra; for his wits
       Are drown'd and lost in his calamities. 1765
       I have but little gold of late, brave Timon,
       The want whereof doth daily make revolt
       In my penurious band: I have heard, and grieved,
       How cursed Athens, mindless of thy worth,
       Forgetting thy great deeds, when neighbour states, 1770
       But for thy sword and fortune, trod upon them,—

     * Timon. I prithee, beat thy drum, and get thee gone.

     * Alcibiades. I am thy friend, and pity thee, dear Timon.

     * Timon. How dost thou pity him whom thou dost trouble?
       I had rather be alone. 1775

     * Alcibiades. Why, fare thee well:
       Here is some gold for thee.

     * Timon. Keep it, I cannot eat it.

     * Alcibiades. When I have laid proud Athens on a heap,—

     * Timon. Warr'st thou 'gainst Athens? 1780

     * Alcibiades. Ay, Timon, and have cause.

     * Timon. The gods confound them all in thy conquest;
       And thee after, when thou hast conquer'd!

     * Alcibiades. Why me, Timon?

     * Timon. That, by killing of villains, 1785
       Thou wast born to conquer my country.
       Put up thy gold: go on,—here's gold,—go on;
       Be as a planetary plague, when Jove
       Will o'er some high-viced city hang his poison
       In the sick air: let not thy sword skip one: 1790
       Pity not honour'd age for his white beard;
       He is an usurer: strike me the counterfeit matron;
       It is her habit only that is honest,
       Herself's a bawd: let not the virgin's cheek
       Make soft thy trenchant sword; for those milk-paps, 1795
       That through the window-bars bore at men's eyes,
       Are not within the leaf of pity writ,
       But set them down horrible traitors: spare not the babe,
       Whose dimpled smiles from fools exhaust their mercy;
       Think it a bastard, whom the oracle 1800
       Hath doubtfully pronounced thy throat shall cut,
       And mince it sans remorse: swear against objects;
       Put armour on thine ears and on thine eyes;
       Whose proof, nor yells of mothers, maids, nor babes,
       Nor sight of priests in holy vestments bleeding, 1805
       Shall pierce a jot. There's gold to pay soldiers:
       Make large confusion; and, thy fury spent,
       Confounded be thyself! Speak not, be gone.

     * Alcibiades. Hast thou gold yet? I'll take the gold thou
       givest me, 1810
       Not all thy counsel.

     * Timon. Dost thou, or dost thou not, heaven's curse
       upon thee!

     * Phrynia. [with Timandra] Give us some gold, good Timon: hast thou
       more?

     * Timon. Enough to make a whore forswear her trade, 1815
       And to make whores, a bawd. Hold up, you sluts,
       Your aprons mountant: you are not oathable,
       Although, I know, you 'll swear, terribly swear
       Into strong shudders and to heavenly agues
       The immortal gods that hear you,—spare your oaths, 1820
       I'll trust to your conditions: be whores still;
       And he whose pious breath seeks to convert you,
       Be strong in whore, allure him, burn him up;
       Let your close fire predominate his smoke,
       And be no turncoats: yet may your pains, six months, 1825
       Be quite contrary: and thatch your poor thin roofs
       With burthens of the dead;—some that were hang'd,
       No matter:—wear them, betray with them: whore still;
       Paint till a horse may mire upon your face,
       A pox of wrinkles! 1830

     * Phrynia. [with Timandra] Well, more gold: what then?

     * Timon. Consumptions sow
       In hollow bones of man; strike their sharp shins,
       And mar men's spurring. Crack the lawyer's voice,
       That he may never more false title plead, 1835
       Nor sound his quillets shrilly: hoar the flamen,
       That scolds against the quality of flesh,
       And not believes himself: down with the nose,
       Down with it flat; take the bridge quite away
       Of him that, his particular to foresee, 1840
       Smells from the general weal: make curl'd-pate
       ruffians bald;
       And let the unscarr'd braggarts of the war
       Derive some pain from you: plague all;
       That your activity may defeat and quell 1845
       The source of all erection. There's more gold:
       Do you damn others, and let this damn you,
       And ditches grave you all!

     * Phrynia. [with Timandra] More counsel with more money, bounteous
       Timon.

     * Timon. More whore, more mischief first; I have given you earnest.
       1850

     * Alcibiades. Strike up the drum towards Athens! Farewell, Timon:
       If I thrive well, I'll visit thee again.

     * Timon. If I hope well, I'll never see thee more.

     * Alcibiades. I never did thee harm.

     * Timon. Yes, thou spokest well of me. 1855

     * Alcibiades. Call'st thou that harm?

     * Timon. Men daily find it. Get thee away, and take
       Thy beagles with thee.

     * Alcibiades. We but offend him. Strike!
       [Drum beats. Exeunt ALCIBIADES, PHRYNIA,] 1860
       and TIMANDRA]

     * Timon. That nature, being sick of man's unkindness,
       Should yet be hungry! Common mother, thou,
       [Digging]
       Whose womb unmeasurable, and infinite breast, 1865
       Teems, and feeds all; whose self-same mettle,
       Whereof thy proud child, arrogant man, is puff'd,
       Engenders the black toad and adder blue,
       The gilded newt and eyeless venom'd worm,
       With all the abhorred births below crisp heaven 1870
       Whereon Hyperion's quickening fire doth shine;
       Yield him, who all thy human sons doth hate,
       From forth thy plenteous bosom, one poor root!
       Ensear thy fertile and conceptious womb,
       Let it no more bring out ingrateful man! 1875
       Go great with tigers, dragons, wolves, and bears;
       Teem with new monsters, whom thy upward face
       Hath to the marbled mansion all above
       Never presented!—O, a root,—dear thanks!—
       Dry up thy marrows, vines, and plough-torn leas; 1880
       Whereof ungrateful man, with liquorish draughts
       And morsels unctuous, greases his pure mind,
       That from it all consideration slips!
       [Enter APEMANTUS]
       More man? plague, plague! 1885

     * Apemantus. I was directed hither: men report
       Thou dost affect my manners, and dost use them.

     * Timon. 'Tis, then, because thou dost not keep a dog,
       Whom I would imitate: consumption catch thee!

     * Apemantus. This is in thee a nature but infected; 1890
       A poor unmanly melancholy sprung
       From change of fortune. Why this spade? this place?
       This slave-like habit? and these looks of care?
       Thy flatterers yet wear silk, drink wine, lie soft;
       Hug their diseased perfumes, and have forgot 1895
       That ever Timon was. Shame not these woods,
       By putting on the cunning of a carper.
       Be thou a flatterer now, and seek to thrive
       By that which has undone thee: hinge thy knee,
       And let his very breath, whom thou'lt observe, 1900
       Blow off thy cap; praise his most vicious strain,
       And call it excellent: thou wast told thus;
       Thou gavest thine ears like tapsters that bid welcome
       To knaves and all approachers: 'tis most just
       That thou turn rascal; hadst thou wealth again, 1905
       Rascals should have 't. Do not assume my likeness.

     * Timon. Were I like thee, I'ld throw away myself.

     * Apemantus. Thou hast cast away thyself, being like thyself;
       A madman so long, now a fool. What, think'st
       That the bleak air, thy boisterous chamberlain, 1910
       Will put thy shirt on warm? will these moss'd trees,
       That have outlived the eagle, page thy heels,
       And skip where thou point'st out? will the
       cold brook,
       Candied with ice, caudle thy morning taste, 1915
       To cure thy o'er-night's surfeit? Call the creatures
       Whose naked natures live in an the spite
       Of wreakful heaven, whose bare unhoused trunks,
       To the conflicting elements exposed,
       Answer mere nature; bid them flatter thee; 1920
       O, thou shalt find—

     * Timon. A fool of thee: depart.

     * Apemantus. I love thee better now than e'er I did.

     * Timon. I hate thee worse.

     * Apemantus. Why? 1925

     * Timon. Thou flatter'st misery.

     * Apemantus. I flatter not; but say thou art a caitiff.

     * Timon. Why dost thou seek me out?

     * Apemantus. To vex thee.

     * Timon. Always a villain's office or a fool's. 1930
       Dost please thyself in't?

     * Apemantus. Ay.

     * Timon. What! a knave too?

     * Apemantus. If thou didst put this sour-cold habit on
       To castigate thy pride, 'twere well: but thou 1935
       Dost it enforcedly; thou'ldst courtier be again,
       Wert thou not beggar. Willing misery
       Outlives encertain pomp, is crown'd before:
       The one is filling still, never complete;
       The other, at high wish: best state, contentless, 1940
       Hath a distracted and most wretched being,
       Worse than the worst, content.
       Thou shouldst desire to die, being miserable.

     * Timon. Not by his breath that is more miserable.
       Thou art a slave, whom Fortune's tender arm 1945
       With favour never clasp'd; but bred a dog.
       Hadst thou, like us from our first swath, proceeded
       The sweet degrees that this brief world affords
       To such as may the passive drugs of it
       Freely command, thou wouldst have plunged thyself 1950
       In general riot; melted down thy youth
       In different beds of lust; and never learn'd
       The icy precepts of respect, but follow'd
       The sugar'd game before thee. But myself,
       Who had the world as my confectionary, 1955
       The mouths, the tongues, the eyes and hearts of men
       At duty, more than I could frame employment,
       That numberless upon me stuck as leaves
       Do on the oak, hive with one winter's brush
       Fell from their boughs and left me open, bare 1960
       For every storm that blows: I, to bear this,
       That never knew but better, is some burden:
       Thy nature did commence in sufferance, time
       Hath made thee hard in't. Why shouldst thou hate men?
       They never flatter'd thee: what hast thou given? 1965
       If thou wilt curse, thy father, that poor rag,
       Must be thy subject, who in spite put stuff
       To some she beggar and compounded thee
       Poor rogue hereditary. Hence, be gone!
       If thou hadst not been born the worst of men, 1970
       Thou hadst been a knave and flatterer.

     * Apemantus. Art thou proud yet?

     * Timon. Ay, that I am not thee.

     * Apemantus. I, that I was
       No prodigal. 1975

     * Timon. I, that I am one now:
       Were all the wealth I have shut up in thee,
       I'ld give thee leave to hang it. Get thee gone.
       That the whole life of Athens were in this!
       Thus would I eat it. 1980

   [Eating a root]
     * Apemantus. Here; I will mend thy feast.

   [Offering him a root]
     * Timon. First mend my company, take away thyself.

     * Apemantus. So I shall mend mine own, by the lack of thine. 1985

     * Timon. 'Tis not well mended so, it is but botch'd;
       if not, I would it were.

     * Apemantus. What wouldst thou have to Athens?

     * Timon. Thee thither in a whirlwind. If thou wilt,
       Tell them there I have gold; look, so I have. 1990

     * Apemantus. Here is no use for gold.

     * Timon. The best and truest;
       For here it sleeps, and does no hired harm.

     * Apemantus. Where liest o' nights, Timon?

     * Timon. Under that's above me. 1995
       Where feed'st thou o' days, Apemantus?

     * Apemantus. Where my stomach finds meat; or, rather, where I eat
       it.

     * Timon. Would poison were obedient and knew my mind!

     * Apemantus. Where wouldst thou send it? 2000

     * Timon. To sauce thy dishes.

     * Apemantus. The middle of humanity thou never knewest, but the
       extremity of both ends: when thou wast in thy gilt
       and thy perfume, they mocked thee for too much
       curiosity; in thy rags thou knowest none, but art 2005
       despised for the contrary. There's a medlar for
       thee, eat it.

     * Timon. On what I hate I feed not.

     * Apemantus. Dost hate a medlar?

     * Timon. Ay, though it look like thee. 2010

     * Apemantus. An thou hadst hated meddlers sooner, thou shouldst
       have loved thyself better now. What man didst thou
       ever know unthrift that was beloved after his means?

     * Timon. Who, without those means thou talkest of, didst thou
       ever know beloved? 2015

     * Apemantus. Myself.

     * Timon. I understand thee; thou hadst some means to keep a
       dog.

     * Apemantus. What things in the world canst thou nearest compare
       to thy flatterers? 2020

     * Timon. Women nearest; but men, men are the things
       themselves. What wouldst thou do with the world,
       Apemantus, if it lay in thy power?

     * Apemantus. Give it the beasts, to be rid of the men.

     * Timon. Wouldst thou have thyself fall in the confusion of 2025
       men, and remain a beast with the beasts?

     * Apemantus. Ay, Timon.

     * Timon. A beastly ambition, which the gods grant thee t'
       attain to! If thou wert the lion, the fox would
       beguile thee; if thou wert the lamb, the fox would 2030
       eat three: if thou wert the fox, the lion would
       suspect thee, when peradventure thou wert accused by
       the ass: if thou wert the ass, thy dulness would
       torment thee, and still thou livedst but as a
       breakfast to the wolf: if thou wert the wolf, thy 2035
       greediness would afflict thee, and oft thou shouldst
       hazard thy life for thy dinner: wert thou the
       unicorn, pride and wrath would confound thee and
       make thine own self the conquest of thy fury: wert
       thou a bear, thou wouldst be killed by the horse: 2040
       wert thou a horse, thou wouldst be seized by the
       leopard: wert thou a leopard, thou wert german to
       the lion and the spots of thy kindred were jurors on
       thy life: all thy safety were remotion and thy
       defence absence. What beast couldst thou be, that 2045
       were not subject to a beast? and what a beast art
       thou already, that seest not thy loss in
       transformation!

     * Apemantus. If thou couldst please me with speaking to me, thou
       mightst have hit upon it here: the commonwealth of 2050
       Athens is become a forest of beasts.

     * Timon. How has the ass broke the wall, that thou art out of the
       city?

     * Apemantus. Yonder comes a poet and a painter: the plague of
       company light upon thee! I will fear to catch it
       and give way: when I know not what else to do, I'll 2055
       see thee again.

     * Timon. When there is nothing living but thee, thou shalt be
       welcome. I had rather be a beggar's dog than Apemantus.

     * Apemantus. Thou art the cap of all the fools alive.

     * Timon. Would thou wert clean enough to spit upon! 2060

     * Apemantus. A plague on thee! thou art too bad to curse.

     * Timon. All villains that do stand by thee are pure.

     * Apemantus. There is no leprosy but what thou speak'st.

     * Timon. If I name thee.
       I'll beat thee, but I should infect my hands. 2065

     * Apemantus. I would my tongue could rot them off!

     * Timon. Away, thou issue of a mangy dog!
       Choler does kill me that thou art alive;
       I swound to see thee.

     * Apemantus. Would thou wouldst burst! 2070

     * Timon. Away,
       Thou tedious rogue! I am sorry I shall lose
       A stone by thee.

   [Throws a stone at him]
     * Apemantus. Beast! 2075

     * Timon. Slave!

     * Apemantus. Toad!

     * Timon. Rogue, rogue, rogue!
       I am sick of this false world, and will love nought
       But even the mere necessities upon 't. 2080
       Then, Timon, presently prepare thy grave;
       Lie where the light foam the sea may beat
       Thy grave-stone daily: make thine epitaph,
       That death in me at others' lives may laugh.
       [To the gold] 2085
       O thou sweet king-killer, and dear divorce
       'Twixt natural son and sire! thou bright defiler
       Of Hymen's purest bed! thou valiant Mars!
       Thou ever young, fresh, loved and delicate wooer,
       Whose blush doth thaw the consecrated snow 2090
       That lies on Dian's lap! thou visible god,
       That solder'st close impossibilities,
       And makest them kiss! that speak'st with
       every tongue,
       To every purpose! O thou touch of hearts! 2095
       Think, thy slave man rebels, and by thy virtue
       Set them into confounding odds, that beasts
       May have the world in empire!

     * Apemantus. Would 'twere so!
       But not till I am dead. I'll say thou'st gold: 2100
       Thou wilt be throng'd to shortly.

     * Timon. Throng'd to!

     * Apemantus. Ay.

     * Timon. Thy back, I prithee.

     * Apemantus. Live, and love thy misery. 2105

     * Timon. Long live so, and so die.
       [Exit APEMANTUS]
       I am quit.
       Moe things like men! Eat, Timon, and abhor them.

   [Enter Banditti]
     * First Bandit. Where should he have this gold? It is some poor
       fragment, some slender sort of his remainder: the
       mere want of gold, and the falling-from of his
       friends, drove him into this melancholy.

     * Second Bandit. It is noised he hath a mass of treasure. 2115

     * Third Bandit. Let us make the assay upon him: if he care not
       for't, he will supply us easily; if he covetously
       reserve it, how shall's get it?

     * Second Bandit. True; for he bears it not about him, 'tis hid.

     * First Bandit. Is not this he? 2120

     * Banditti. Where?

     * Second Bandit. 'Tis his description.

     * Third Bandit. He; I know him.

     * Banditti. Save thee, Timon.

     * Timon. Now, thieves? 2125

     * Banditti. Soldiers, not thieves.

     * Timon. Both too; and women's sons.

     * Banditti. We are not thieves, but men that much do want.

     * Timon. Your greatest want is, you want much of meat.
       Why should you want? Behold, the earth hath roots; 2130
       Within this mile break forth a hundred springs;
       The oaks bear mast, the briers scarlet hips;
       The bounteous housewife, nature, on each bush
       Lays her full mess before you. Want! why want?

     * First Bandit. We cannot live on grass, on berries, water, 2135
       As beasts and birds and fishes.

     * Timon. Nor on the beasts themselves, the birds, and fishes;
       You must eat men. Yet thanks I must you con
       That you are thieves profess'd, that you work not
       In holier shapes: for there is boundless theft 2140
       In limited professions. Rascal thieves,
       Here's gold. Go, suck the subtle blood o' the grape,
       Till the high fever seethe your blood to froth,
       And so 'scape hanging: trust not the physician;
       His antidotes are poison, and he slays 2145
       Moe than you rob: take wealth and lives together;
       Do villany, do, since you protest to do't,
       Like workmen. I'll example you with thievery.
       The sun's a thief, and with his great attraction
       Robs the vast sea: the moon's an arrant thief, 2150
       And her pale fire she snatches from the sun:
       The sea's a thief, whose liquid surge resolves
       The moon into salt tears: the earth's a thief,
       That feeds and breeds by a composture stolen
       From general excrement: each thing's a thief: 2155
       The laws, your curb and whip, in their rough power
       Have uncheque'd theft. Love not yourselves: away,
       Rob one another. There's more gold. Cut throats:
       All that you meet are thieves: to Athens go,
       Break open shops; nothing can you steal, 2160
       But thieves do lose it: steal no less for this
       I give you; and gold confound you howsoe'er! Amen.

     * Third Bandit. Has almost charmed me from my profession, by
       persuading me to it.

     * First Bandit. 'Tis in the malice of mankind that he thus advises
       2165
       us; not to have us thrive in our mystery.

     * Second Bandit. I'll believe him as an enemy, and give over my
       trade.

     * First Bandit. Let us first see peace in Athens: there is no time
       so miserable but a man may be true.

   [Exeunt Banditti]

   [Enter FLAVIUS]
     * Flavius. O you gods!
       Is yond despised and ruinous man my lord?
       Full of decay and failing? O monument
       And wonder of good deeds evilly bestow'd! 2175
       What an alteration of honour
       Has desperate want made!
       What viler thing upon the earth than friends
       Who can bring noblest minds to basest ends!
       How rarely does it meet with this time's guise, 2180
       When man was wish'd to love his enemies!
       Grant I may ever love, and rather woo
       Those that would mischief me than those that do!
       Has caught me in his eye: I will present
       My honest grief unto him; and, as my lord, 2185
       Still serve him with my life. My dearest master!

     * Timon. Away! what art thou?

     * Flavius. Have you forgot me, sir?

     * Timon. Why dost ask that? I have forgot all men;
       Then, if thou grant'st thou'rt a man, I have forgot thee. 2190

     * Flavius. An honest poor servant of yours.

     * Timon. Then I know thee not:
       I never had honest man about me, I; all
       I kept were knaves, to serve in meat to villains.

     * Flavius. The gods are witness, 2195
       Ne'er did poor steward wear a truer grief
       For his undone lord than mine eyes for you.

     * Timon. What, dost thou weep? Come nearer. Then I
       love thee,
       Because thou art a woman, and disclaim'st 2200
       Flinty mankind; whose eyes do never give
       But thorough lust and laughter. Pity's sleeping:
       Strange times, that weep with laughing, not with weeping!

     * Flavius. I beg of you to know me, good my lord,
       To accept my grief and whilst this poor wealth lasts 2205
       To entertain me as your steward still.

     * Timon. Had I a steward
       So true, so just, and now so comfortable?
       It almost turns my dangerous nature mild.
       Let me behold thy face. Surely, this man 2210
       Was born of woman.
       Forgive my general and exceptless rashness,
       You perpetual-sober gods! I do proclaim
       One honest man—mistake me not—but one;
       No more, I pray,—and he's a steward. 2215
       How fain would I have hated all mankind!
       And thou redeem'st thyself: but all, save thee,
       I fell with curses.
       Methinks thou art more honest now than wise;
       For, by oppressing and betraying me, 2220
       Thou mightst have sooner got another service:
       For many so arrive at second masters,
       Upon their first lord's neck. But tell me true—
       For I must ever doubt, though ne'er so sure—
       Is not thy kindness subtle, covetous, 2225
       If not a usuring kindness, and, as rich men deal gifts,
       Expecting in return twenty for one?

     * Flavius. No, my most worthy master; in whose breast
       Doubt and suspect, alas, are placed too late:
       You should have fear'd false times when you did feast: 2230
       Suspect still comes where an estate is least.
       That which I show, heaven knows, is merely love,
       Duty and zeal to your unmatched mind,
       Care of your food and living; and, believe it,
       My most honour'd lord, 2235
       For any benefit that points to me,
       Either in hope or present, I'ld exchange
       For this one wish, that you had power and wealth
       To requite me, by making rich yourself.

     * Timon. Look thee, 'tis so! Thou singly honest man, 2240
       Here, take: the gods out of my misery
       Have sent thee treasure. Go, live rich and happy;
       But thus condition'd: thou shalt build from men;
       Hate all, curse all, show charity to none,
       But let the famish'd flesh slide from the bone, 2245
       Ere thou relieve the beggar; give to dogs
       What thou deny'st to men; let prisons swallow 'em,
       Debts wither 'em to nothing; be men like
       blasted woods,
       And may diseases lick up their false bloods! 2250
       And so farewell and thrive.

     * Flavius. O, let me stay,
       And comfort you, my master.

     * Timon. If thou hatest curses,
       Stay not; fly, whilst thou art blest and free: 2255
       Ne'er see thou man, and let me ne'er see thee.

   [Exit FLAVIUS. TIMON retires to his cave]
   _______________________________________________________________________



   Act V, Scene 1

   The woods. Before Timon’s cave.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   [Enter Poet and Painter; TIMON watching] [p]them from his cave]
     * Painter. As I took note of the place, it cannot be far where 2260
       he abides.

     * Poet. What's to be thought of him? does the rumour hold
       for true, that he's so full of gold?

     * Painter. Certain: Alcibiades reports it; Phrynia and
       Timandra had gold of him: he likewise enriched poor 2265
       straggling soldiers with great quantity: 'tis said
       he gave unto his steward a mighty sum.

     * Poet. Then this breaking of his has been but a try for his friends.

     * Painter. Nothing else: you shall see him a palm in Athens
       again, and flourish with the highest. Therefore 2270
       'tis not amiss we tender our loves to him, in this
       supposed distress of his: it will show honestly in
       us; and is very likely to load our purposes with
       what they travail for, if it be a just true report
       that goes of his having. 2275

     * Poet. What have you now to present unto him?

     * Painter. Nothing at this time but my visitation: only I will
       promise him an excellent piece.

     * Poet. I must serve him so too, tell him of an intent
       that's coming toward him. 2280

     * Painter. Good as the best. Promising is the very air o' the
       time: it opens the eyes of expectation:
       performance is ever the duller for his act; and,
       but in the plainer and simpler kind of people, the
       deed of saying is quite out of use. To promise is 2285
       most courtly and fashionable: performance is a kind
       of will or testament which argues a great sickness
       in his judgment that makes it.

   [TIMON comes from his cave, behind]
     * Timon. [Aside] Excellent workman! thou canst not paint a 2290
       man so bad as is thyself.

     * Poet. I am thinking what I shall say I have provided for
       him: it must be a personating of himself; a satire
       against the softness of prosperity, with a discovery
       of the infinite flatteries that follow youth and opulency. 2295

     * Timon. [Aside] Must thou needs stand for a villain in
       thine own work? wilt thou whip thine own faults in
       other men? Do so, I have gold for thee.

     * Poet. Nay, let's seek him:
       Then do we sin against our own estate, 2300
       When we may profit meet, and come too late.

     * Painter. True;
       When the day serves, before black-corner'd night,
       Find what thou want'st by free and offer'd light. Come.

     * Timon. [Aside] I'll meet you at the turn. What a 2305
       god's gold,
       That he is worshipp'd in a baser temple
       Than where swine feed!
       'Tis thou that rigg'st the bark and plough'st the foam,
       Settlest admired reverence in a slave: 2310
       To thee be worship! and thy saints for aye
       Be crown'd with plagues that thee alone obey!
       Fit I meet them.

   [Coming forward]
     * Poet. Hail, worthy Timon! 2315

     * Painter. Our late noble master!

     * Timon. Have I once lived to see two honest men?

     * Poet. Sir,
       Having often of your open bounty tasted,
       Hearing you were retired, your friends fall'n off, 2320
       Whose thankless natures—O abhorred spirits!—
       Not all the whips of heaven are large enough:
       What! to you,
       Whose star-like nobleness gave life and influence
       To their whole being! I am rapt and cannot cover 2325
       The monstrous bulk of this ingratitude
       With any size of words.

     * Timon. Let it go naked, men may see't the better:
       You that are honest, by being what you are,
       Make them best seen and known. 2330

     * Painter. He and myself
       Have travail'd in the great shower of your gifts,
       And sweetly felt it.

     * Timon. Ay, you are honest men.

     * Painter. We are hither come to offer you our service. 2335

     * Timon. Most honest men! Why, how shall I requite you?
       Can you eat roots, and drink cold water? no.

     * Both. What we can do, we'll do, to do you service.

     * Timon. Ye're honest men: ye've heard that I have gold;
       I am sure you have: speak truth; ye're honest men. 2340

     * Painter. So it is said, my noble lord; but therefore
       Came not my friend nor I.

     * Timon. Good honest men! Thou draw'st a counterfeit
       Best in all Athens: thou'rt, indeed, the best;
       Thou counterfeit'st most lively. 2345

     * Painter. So, so, my lord.

     * Timon. E'en so, sir, as I say. And, for thy fiction,
       Why, thy verse swells with stuff so fine and smooth
       That thou art even natural in thine art.
       But, for all this, my honest-natured friends, 2350
       I must needs say you have a little fault:
       Marry, 'tis not monstrous in you, neither wish I
       You take much pains to mend.

     * Both. Beseech your honour
       To make it known to us. 2355

     * Timon. You'll take it ill.

     * Both. Most thankfully, my lord.

     * Timon. Will you, indeed?

     * Both. Doubt it not, worthy lord.

     * Timon. There's never a one of you but trusts a knave, 2360
       That mightily deceives you.

     * Both. Do we, my lord?

     * Timon. Ay, and you hear him cog, see him dissemble,
       Know his gross patchery, love him, feed him,
       Keep in your bosom: yet remain assured 2365
       That he's a made-up villain.

     * Painter. I know none such, my lord.

     * Poet. Nor I.

     * Timon. Look you, I love you well; I'll give you gold,
       Rid me these villains from your companies: 2370
       Hang them or stab them, drown them in a draught,
       Confound them by some course, and come to me,
       I'll give you gold enough.

     * Both. Name them, my lord, let's know them.

     * Timon. You that way and you this, but two in company; 2375
       Each man apart, all single and alone,
       Yet an arch-villain keeps him company.
       If where thou art two villains shall not be,
       Come not near him. If thou wouldst not reside
       But where one villain is, then him abandon. 2380
       Hence, pack! there's gold; you came for gold, ye slaves:
       [To Painter]
       You have work'd for me; there's payment for you: hence!
       [To Poet]
       You are an alchemist; make gold of that. 2385
       Out, rascal dogs!

   [Beats them out, and then retires to his cave]

   [Enter FLAVIUS and two Senators]
     * Flavius. It is in vain that you would speak with Timon;
       For he is set so only to himself 2390
       That nothing but himself which looks like man
       Is friendly with him.

     * First Senator. Bring us to his cave:
       It is our part and promise to the Athenians
       To speak with Timon. 2395

     * Second Senator. At all times alike
       Men are not still the same: 'twas time and griefs
       That framed him thus: time, with his fairer hand,
       Offering the fortunes of his former days,
       The former man may make him. Bring us to him, 2400
       And chance it as it may.

     * Flavius. Here is his cave.
       Peace and content be here! Lord Timon! Timon!
       Look out, and speak to friends: the Athenians,
       By two of their most reverend senate, greet thee: 2405
       Speak to them, noble Timon.

   [TIMON comes from his cave]
     * Timon. Thou sun, that comfort'st, burn! Speak, and
       be hang'd:
       For each true word, a blister! and each false 2410
       Be as cauterizing to the root o' the tongue,
       Consuming it with speaking!

     * First Senator. Worthy Timon,—

     * Timon. Of none but such as you, and you of Timon.

     * First Senator. The senators of Athens greet thee, Timon. 2415

     * Timon. I thank them; and would send them back the plague,
       Could I but catch it for them.

     * First Senator. O, forget
       What we are sorry for ourselves in thee.
       The senators with one consent of love 2420
       Entreat thee back to Athens; who have thought
       On special dignities, which vacant lie
       For thy best use and wearing.

     * Second Senator. They confess
       Toward thee forgetfulness too general, gross: 2425
       Which now the public body, which doth seldom
       Play the recanter, feeling in itself
       A lack of Timon's aid, hath sense withal
       Of its own fail, restraining aid to Timon;
       And send forth us, to make their sorrow'd render, 2430
       Together with a recompense more fruitful
       Than their offence can weigh down by the dram;
       Ay, even such heaps and sums of love and wealth
       As shall to thee blot out what wrongs were theirs
       And write in thee the figures of their love, 2435
       Ever to read them thine.

     * Timon. You witch me in it;
       Surprise me to the very brink of tears:
       Lend me a fool's heart and a woman's eyes,
       And I'll beweep these comforts, worthy senators. 2440

     * First Senator. Therefore, so please thee to return with us
       And of our Athens, thine and ours, to take
       The captainship, thou shalt be met with thanks,
       Allow'd with absolute power and thy good name
       Live with authority: so soon we shall drive back 2445
       Of Alcibiades the approaches wild,
       Who, like a boar too savage, doth root up
       His country's peace.

     * Second Senator. And shakes his threatening sword
       Against the walls of Athens. 2450

     * First Senator. Therefore, Timon,—

     * Timon. Well, sir, I will; therefore, I will, sir; thus:
       If Alcibiades kill my countrymen,
       Let Alcibiades know this of Timon,
       That Timon cares not. But if be sack fair Athens, 2455
       And take our goodly aged men by the beards,
       Giving our holy virgins to the stain
       Of contumelious, beastly, mad-brain'd war,
       Then let him know, and tell him Timon speaks it,
       In pity of our aged and our youth, 2460
       I cannot choose but tell him, that I care not,
       And let him take't at worst; for their knives care not,
       While you have throats to answer: for myself,
       There's not a whittle in the unruly camp
       But I do prize it at my love before 2465
       The reverend'st throat in Athens. So I leave you
       To the protection of the prosperous gods,
       As thieves to keepers.

     * Flavius. Stay not, all's in vain.

     * Timon. Why, I was writing of my epitaph; 2470
       it will be seen to-morrow: my long sickness
       Of health and living now begins to mend,
       And nothing brings me all things. Go, live still;
       Be Alcibiades your plague, you his,
       And last so long enough! 2475

     * First Senator. We speak in vain.

     * Timon. But yet I love my country, and am not
       One that rejoices in the common wreck,
       As common bruit doth put it.

     * First Senator. That's well spoke. 2480

     * Timon. Commend me to my loving countrymen,—

     * First Senator. These words become your lips as they pass
       thorough them.

     * Second Senator. And enter in our ears like great triumphers
       In their applauding gates. 2485

     * Timon. Commend me to them,
       And tell them that, to ease them of their griefs,
       Their fears of hostile strokes, their aches, losses,
       Their pangs of love, with other incident throes
       That nature's fragile vessel doth sustain 2490
       In life's uncertain voyage, I will some kindness do them:
       I'll teach them to prevent wild Alcibiades' wrath.

     * First Senator. I like this well; he will return again.

     * Timon. I have a tree, which grows here in my close,
       That mine own use invites me to cut down, 2495
       And shortly must I fell it: tell my friends,
       Tell Athens, in the sequence of degree
       From high to low throughout, that whoso please
       To stop affliction, let him take his haste,
       Come hither, ere my tree hath felt the axe, 2500
       And hang himself. I pray you, do my greeting.

     * Flavius. Trouble him no further; thus you still shall find him.

     * Timon. Come not to me again: but say to Athens,
       Timon hath made his everlasting mansion
       Upon the beached verge of the salt flood; 2505
       Who once a day with his embossed froth
       The turbulent surge shall cover: thither come,
       And let my grave-stone be your oracle.
       Lips, let sour words go by and language end:
       What is amiss plague and infection mend! 2510
       Graves only be men's works and death their gain!
       Sun, hide thy beams! Timon hath done his reign.

   [Retires to his cave]
     * First Senator. His discontents are unremoveably
       Coupled to nature. 2515

     * Second Senator. Our hope in him is dead: let us return,
       And strain what other means is left unto us
       In our dear peril.

     * First Senator. It requires swift foot.

   [Exeunt]

   Act V, Scene 2

   Before the walls of Athens.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   [Enter two Senators and a Messenger]
     * First Senator. Thou hast painfully discover'd: are his files
       As full as thy report?

     * Messenger. have spoke the least:
       Besides, his expedition promises 2525
       Present approach.

     * Second Senator. We stand much hazard, if they bring not Timon.

     * Messenger. I met a courier, one mine ancient friend;
       Whom, though in general part we were opposed,
       Yet our old love made a particular force, 2530
       And made us speak like friends: this man was riding
       From Alcibiades to Timon's cave,
       With letters of entreaty, which imported
       His fellowship i' the cause against your city,
       In part for his sake moved. 2535

     * First Senator. Here come our brothers.

   [Enter the Senators from TIMON]
     * Third Senator. No talk of Timon, nothing of him expect.
       The enemies' drum is heard, and fearful scouring
       Doth choke the air with dust: in, and prepare: 2540
       Ours is the fall, I fear; our foes the snare.

   [Exeunt]

   Act V, Scene 3

   The woods. Timon’s cave, and a rude tomb seen.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   [Enter a Soldier, seeking TIMON]
     * Soldier. By all description this should be the place.
       Who's here? speak, ho! No answer! What is this? 2545
       Timon is dead, who hath outstretch'd his span:
       Some beast rear'd this; there does not live a man.
       Dead, sure; and this his grave. What's on this tomb
       I cannot read; the character I'll take with wax:
       Our captain hath in every figure skill, 2550
       An aged interpreter, though young in days:
       Before proud Athens he's set down by this,
       Whose fall the mark of his ambition is.

   [Trumpets sound. Enter ALCIBIADES with his powers]
     * Alcibiades. Sound to this coward and lascivious town
       Our terrible approach.
       [A parley sounded]
       [Enter Senators on the walls]
       Till now you have gone on and fill'd the time 2560
       With all licentious measure, making your wills
       The scope of justice; till now myself and such
       As slept within the shadow of your power
       Have wander'd with our traversed arms and breathed
       Our sufferance vainly: now the time is flush, 2565
       When crouching marrow in the bearer strong
       Cries of itself 'No more:' now breathless wrong
       Shall sit and pant in your great chairs of ease,
       And pursy insolence shall break his wind
       With fear and horrid flight. 2570

     * First Senator. Noble and young,
       When thy first griefs were but a mere conceit,
       Ere thou hadst power or we had cause of fear,
       We sent to thee, to give thy rages balm,
       To wipe out our ingratitude with loves 2575
       Above their quantity.

     * Second Senator. So did we woo
       Transformed Timon to our city's love
       By humble message and by promised means:
       We were not all unkind, nor all deserve 2580
       The common stroke of war.

     * First Senator. These walls of ours
       Were not erected by their hands from whom
       You have received your griefs; nor are they such
       That these great towers, trophies and schools 2585
       should fall
       For private faults in them.

     * Second Senator. Nor are they living
       Who were the motives that you first went out;
       Shame that they wanted cunning, in excess 2590
       Hath broke their hearts. March, noble lord,
       Into our city with thy banners spread:
       By decimation, and a tithed death—
       If thy revenges hunger for that food
       Which nature loathes—take thou the destined tenth, 2595
       And by the hazard of the spotted die
       Let die the spotted.

     * First Senator. All have not offended;
       For those that were, it is not square to take
       On those that are, revenges: crimes, like lands, 2600
       Are not inherited. Then, dear countryman,
       Bring in thy ranks, but leave without thy rage:
       Spare thy Athenian cradle and those kin
       Which in the bluster of thy wrath must fall
       With those that have offended: like a shepherd, 2605
       Approach the fold and cull the infected forth,
       But kill not all together.

     * Second Senator. What thou wilt,
       Thou rather shalt enforce it with thy smile
       Than hew to't with thy sword. 2610

     * First Senator. Set but thy foot
       Against our rampired gates, and they shall ope;
       So thou wilt send thy gentle heart before,
       To say thou'lt enter friendly.

     * Second Senator. Throw thy glove, 2615
       Or any token of thine honour else,
       That thou wilt use the wars as thy redress
       And not as our confusion, all thy powers
       Shall make their harbour in our town, till we
       Have seal'd thy full desire. 2620

     * Alcibiades. Then there's my glove;
       Descend, and open your uncharged ports:
       Those enemies of Timon's and mine own
       Whom you yourselves shall set out for reproof
       Fall and no more: and, to atone your fears 2625
       With my more noble meaning, not a man
       Shall pass his quarter, or offend the stream
       Of regular justice in your city's bounds,
       But shall be render'd to your public laws
       At heaviest answer. 2630

     * Both. 'Tis most nobly spoken.

     * Alcibiades. Descend, and keep your words.

   [The Senators descend, and open the gates]

   [Enter Soldier]
     * Soldier. My noble general, Timon is dead; 2635
       Entomb'd upon the very hem o' the sea;
       And on his grave-stone this insculpture, which
       With wax I brought away, whose soft impression
       Interprets for my poor ignorance.

     * Alcibiades. [Reads the epitaph] 'Here lies a 2640
       wretched corse, of wretched soul bereft:
       Seek not my name: a plague consume you wicked
       caitiffs left!
       Here lie I, Timon; who, alive, all living men did hate:
       Pass by and curse thy fill, but pass and stay 2645
       not here thy gait.'
       These well express in thee thy latter spirits:
       Though thou abhorr'dst in us our human griefs,
       Scorn'dst our brain's flow and those our
       droplets which 2650
       From niggard nature fall, yet rich conceit
       Taught thee to make vast Neptune weep for aye
       On thy low grave, on faults forgiven. Dead
       Is noble Timon: of whose memory
       Hereafter more. Bring me into your city, 2655
       And I will use the olive with my sword,
       Make war breed peace, make peace stint war, make each
       Prescribe to other as each other's leech.
       Let our drums strike.

   [Exeunt]
