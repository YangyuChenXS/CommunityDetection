                                SONNET LXIII

                   Against my love shall be, as I am now,
              With Time's injurious hand crush'd and o'er-worn;
            When hours have drain'd his blood and fill'd his brow
               With lines and wrinkles; when his youthful morn
                 Hath travell'd on to age's steepy night, 5
                And all those beauties whereof now he's king
                   Are vanishing or vanish'd out of sight,
                  Stealing away the treasure of his spring;
                      For such a time do I now fortify
                  Against confounding age's cruel knife, 10
                     That he shall never cut from memory
               My sweet love's beauty, though my lover's life:
                 His beauty shall in these black lines be seen,
               And they shall live, and he in them still green. 14
