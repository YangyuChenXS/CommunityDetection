                                 SONNET XXVI

                    Lord of my love, to whom in vassalage
                    Thy merit hath my duty strongly knit,
                   To thee I send this written embassage,
                    To witness duty, not to show my wit:
                 Duty so great, which wit so poor as mine 5
              May make seem bare, in wanting words to show it,
                 But that I hope some good conceit of thine
              In thy soul's thought, all naked, will bestow it;
                 Till whatsoever star that guides my moving
                 Points on me graciously with fair aspect 10
                   And puts apparel on my tatter'd loving,
                   To show me worthy of thy sweet respect:
                  Then may I dare to boast how I do love thee;
            Till then not show my head where thou mayst prove me. 14
