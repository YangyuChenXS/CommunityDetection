                                 SONNET LVI

                 Sweet love, renew thy force; be it not said
                  Thy edge should blunter be than appetite,
                   Which but to-day by feeding is allay'd,
                  To-morrow sharpen'd in his former might:
               So, love, be thou; although to-day thou fill 5
             Thy hungry eyes even till they wink with fullness,
                    To-morrow see again, and do not kill
                The spirit of love with a perpetual dullness.
                   Let this sad interim like the ocean be
             Which parts the shore, where two contracted new 10
                Come daily to the banks, that, when they see
                 Return of love, more blest may be the view;
                  Else call it winter, which being full of care
            Makes summer's welcome thrice more wish'd, more rare. 14

                                      O
