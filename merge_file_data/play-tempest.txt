   Act I, Scene 1

   On a ship at sea: a tempestuous noise
   _______________________________________________________________________

   of thunder and lightning heard.

   [Enter a Master and a Boatswain]
     * Master. Boatswain!

     * Boatswain. Here, master: what cheer?

     * Master. Good, speak to the mariners: fall to't, yarely, 5
       or we run ourselves aground: bestir, bestir.

   [Exit]

   [Enter Mariners]
     * Boatswain. Heigh, my hearts! cheerly, cheerly, my hearts!
       yare, yare! Take in the topsail. Tend to the 10
       master's whistle. Blow, till thou burst thy wind,
       if room enough!
       [Enter ALONSO, SEBASTIAN, ANTONIO, FERDINAND,]
       GONZALO, and others]

     * Alonso. Good boatswain, have care. Where's the master? 15
       Play the men.

     * Boatswain. I pray now, keep below.

     * Antonio. Where is the master, boatswain?

     * Boatswain. Do you not hear him? You mar our labour: keep your
       cabins: you do assist the storm. 20

     * Gonzalo. Nay, good, be patient.

     * Boatswain. When the sea is. Hence! What cares these roarers
       for the name of king? To cabin: silence! trouble us not.

     * Gonzalo. Good, yet remember whom thou hast aboard.

     * Boatswain. None that I more love than myself. You are a 25
       counsellor; if you can command these elements to
       silence, and work the peace of the present, we will
       not hand a rope more; use your authority: if you
       cannot, give thanks you have lived so long, and make
       yourself ready in your cabin for the mischance of 30
       the hour, if it so hap. Cheerly, good hearts! Out
       of our way, I say.

   [Exit]
     * Gonzalo. I have great comfort from this fellow: methinks he
       hath no drowning mark upon him; his complexion is 35
       perfect gallows. Stand fast, good Fate, to his
       hanging: make the rope of his destiny our cable,
       for our own doth little advantage. If he be not
       born to be hanged, our case is miserable.

   [Exeunt]

   [Re-enter Boatswain]
     * Boatswain. Down with the topmast! yare! lower, lower! Bring
       her to try with main-course.
       [A cry within]
       A plague upon this howling! they are louder than 45
       the weather or our office.
       [Re-enter SEBASTIAN, ANTONIO, and GONZALO]
       Yet again! what do you here? Shall we give o'er
       and drown? Have you a mind to sink?

     * Sebastian. A pox o' your throat, you bawling, blasphemous, 50
       incharitable dog!

     * Boatswain. Work you then.

     * Antonio. Hang, cur! hang, you whoreson, insolent noisemaker!
       We are less afraid to be drowned than thou art.

     * Gonzalo. I'll warrant him for drowning; though the ship were 55
       no stronger than a nutshell and as leaky as an
       unstanched wench.

     * Boatswain. Lay her a-hold, a-hold! set her two courses off to
       sea again; lay her off.

   [Enter Mariners wet]
     * Mariners. All lost! to prayers, to prayers! all lost!

     * Boatswain. What, must our mouths be cold?

     * Gonzalo. The king and prince at prayers! let's assist them,
       For our case is as theirs.

     * Sebastian. I'm out of patience. 65

     * Antonio. We are merely cheated of our lives by drunkards:
       This wide-chapp'd rascal—would thou mightst lie drowning
       The washing of ten tides!

     * Gonzalo. He'll be hang'd yet,
       Though every drop of water swear against it 70
       And gape at widest to glut him.
       [A confused noise within: 'Mercy on us!'—]
       'We split, we split!'—'Farewell, my wife and
       children!'—
       'Farewell, brother!'—'We split, we split, we split!'] 75

     * Antonio. Let's all sink with the king.

     * Sebastian. Let's take leave of him.

   [Exeunt ANTONIO and SEBASTIAN]
     * Gonzalo. Now would I give a thousand furlongs of sea for an
       acre of barren ground, long heath, brown furze, any 80
       thing. The wills above be done! but I would fain
       die a dry death.

   [Exeunt]

   Act I, Scene 2

   The island. Before PROSPERO’S cell.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   [Enter PROSPERO and MIRANDA]
     * Miranda. If by your art, my dearest father, you have 85
       Put the wild waters in this roar, allay them.
       The sky, it seems, would pour down stinking pitch,
       But that the sea, mounting to the welkin's cheek,
       Dashes the fire out. O, I have suffered
       With those that I saw suffer: a brave vessel, 90
       Who had, no doubt, some noble creature in her,
       Dash'd all to pieces. O, the cry did knock
       Against my very heart. Poor souls, they perish'd.
       Had I been any god of power, I would
       Have sunk the sea within the earth or ere 95
       It should the good ship so have swallow'd and
       The fraughting souls within her.

     * Prospero. Be collected:
       No more amazement: tell your piteous heart
       There's no harm done. 100

     * Miranda. O, woe the day!

     * Prospero. No harm.
       I have done nothing but in care of thee,
       Of thee, my dear one, thee, my daughter, who
       Art ignorant of what thou art, nought knowing 105
       Of whence I am, nor that I am more better
       Than Prospero, master of a full poor cell,
       And thy no greater father.

     * Miranda. More to know
       Did never meddle with my thoughts. 110

     * Prospero. 'Tis time
       I should inform thee farther. Lend thy hand,
       And pluck my magic garment from me. So:
       [Lays down his mantle]
       Lie there, my art. Wipe thou thine eyes; have comfort. 115
       The direful spectacle of the wreck, which touch'd
       The very virtue of compassion in thee,
       I have with such provision in mine art
       So safely ordered that there is no soul—
       No, not so much perdition as an hair 120
       Betid to any creature in the vessel
       Which thou heard'st cry, which thou saw'st sink. Sit down;
       For thou must now know farther.

     * Miranda. You have often
       Begun to tell me what I am, but stopp'd 125
       And left me to a bootless inquisition,
       Concluding 'Stay: not yet.'

     * Prospero. The hour's now come;
       The very minute bids thee ope thine ear;
       Obey and be attentive. Canst thou remember 130
       A time before we came unto this cell?
       I do not think thou canst, for then thou wast not
       Out three years old.

     * Miranda. Certainly, sir, I can.

     * Prospero. By what? by any other house or person? 135
       Of any thing the image tell me that
       Hath kept with thy remembrance.

     * Miranda. 'Tis far off
       And rather like a dream than an assurance
       That my remembrance warrants. Had I not 140
       Four or five women once that tended me?

     * Prospero. Thou hadst, and more, Miranda. But how is it
       That this lives in thy mind? What seest thou else
       In the dark backward and abysm of time?
       If thou remember'st aught ere thou camest here, 145
       How thou camest here thou mayst.

     * Miranda. But that I do not.

     * Prospero. Twelve year since, Miranda, twelve year since,
       Thy father was the Duke of Milan and
       A prince of power. 150

     * Miranda. Sir, are not you my father?

     * Prospero. Thy mother was a piece of virtue, and
       She said thou wast my daughter; and thy father
       Was Duke of Milan; and thou his only heir
       And princess no worse issued. 155

     * Miranda. O the heavens!
       What foul play had we, that we came from thence?
       Or blessed was't we did?

     * Prospero. Both, both, my girl:
       By foul play, as thou say'st, were we heaved thence, 160
       But blessedly holp hither.

     * Miranda. O, my heart bleeds
       To think o' the teen that I have turn'd you to,
       Which is from my remembrance! Please you, farther.

     * Prospero. My brother and thy uncle, call'd Antonio— 165
       I pray thee, mark me—that a brother should
       Be so perfidious!—he whom next thyself
       Of all the world I loved and to him put
       The manage of my state; as at that time
       Through all the signories it was the first 170
       And Prospero the prime duke, being so reputed
       In dignity, and for the liberal arts
       Without a parallel; those being all my study,
       The government I cast upon my brother
       And to my state grew stranger, being transported 175
       And rapt in secret studies. Thy false uncle—
       Dost thou attend me?

     * Miranda. Sir, most heedfully.

     * Prospero. Being once perfected how to grant suits,
       How to deny them, who to advance and who 180
       To trash for over-topping, new created
       The creatures that were mine, I say, or changed 'em,
       Or else new form'd 'em; having both the key
       Of officer and office, set all hearts i' the state
       To what tune pleased his ear; that now he was 185
       The ivy which had hid my princely trunk,
       And suck'd my verdure out on't. Thou attend'st not.

     * Miranda. O, good sir, I do.

     * Prospero. I pray thee, mark me.
       I, thus neglecting worldly ends, all dedicated 190
       To closeness and the bettering of my mind
       With that which, but by being so retired,
       O'er-prized all popular rate, in my false brother
       Awaked an evil nature; and my trust,
       Like a good parent, did beget of him 195
       A falsehood in its contrary as great
       As my trust was; which had indeed no limit,
       A confidence sans bound. He being thus lorded,
       Not only with what my revenue yielded,
       But what my power might else exact, like one 200
       Who having into truth, by telling of it,
       Made such a sinner of his memory,
       To credit his own lie, he did believe
       He was indeed the duke; out o' the substitution
       And executing the outward face of royalty, 205
       With all prerogative: hence his ambition growing—
       Dost thou hear?

     * Miranda. Your tale, sir, would cure deafness.

     * Prospero. To have no screen between this part he play'd
       And him he play'd it for, he needs will be 210
       Absolute Milan. Me, poor man, my library
       Was dukedom large enough: of temporal royalties
       He thinks me now incapable; confederates—
       So dry he was for sway—wi' the King of Naples
       To give him annual tribute, do him homage, 215
       Subject his coronet to his crown and bend
       The dukedom yet unbow'd—alas, poor Milan!—
       To most ignoble stooping.

     * Miranda. O the heavens!

     * Prospero. Mark his condition and the event; then tell me 220
       If this might be a brother.

     * Miranda. I should sin
       To think but nobly of my grandmother:
       Good wombs have borne bad sons.

     * Prospero. Now the condition. 225
       The King of Naples, being an enemy
       To me inveterate, hearkens my brother's suit;
       Which was, that he, in lieu o' the premises
       Of homage and I know not how much tribute,
       Should presently extirpate me and mine 230
       Out of the dukedom and confer fair Milan
       With all the honours on my brother: whereon,
       A treacherous army levied, one midnight
       Fated to the purpose did Antonio open
       The gates of Milan, and, i' the dead of darkness, 235
       The ministers for the purpose hurried thence
       Me and thy crying self.

     * Miranda. Alack, for pity!
       I, not remembering how I cried out then,
       Will cry it o'er again: it is a hint 240
       That wrings mine eyes to't.

     * Prospero. Hear a little further
       And then I'll bring thee to the present business
       Which now's upon's; without the which this story
       Were most impertinent. 245

     * Miranda. Wherefore did they not
       That hour destroy us?

     * Prospero. Well demanded, wench:
       My tale provokes that question. Dear, they durst not,
       So dear the love my people bore me, nor set 250
       A mark so bloody on the business, but
       With colours fairer painted their foul ends.
       In few, they hurried us aboard a bark,
       Bore us some leagues to sea; where they prepared
       A rotten carcass of a boat, not rigg'd, 255
       Nor tackle, sail, nor mast; the very rats
       Instinctively had quit it: there they hoist us,
       To cry to the sea that roar'd to us, to sigh
       To the winds whose pity, sighing back again,
       Did us but loving wrong. 260

     * Miranda. Alack, what trouble
       Was I then to you!

     * Prospero. O, a cherubim
       Thou wast that did preserve me. Thou didst smile.
       Infused with a fortitude from heaven, 265
       When I have deck'd the sea with drops full salt,
       Under my burthen groan'd; which raised in me
       An undergoing stomach, to bear up
       Against what should ensue.

     * Miranda. How came we ashore? 270

     * Prospero. By Providence divine.
       Some food we had and some fresh water that
       A noble Neapolitan, Gonzalo,
       Out of his charity, being then appointed
       Master of this design, did give us, with 275
       Rich garments, linens, stuffs and necessaries,
       Which since have steaded much; so, of his gentleness,
       Knowing I loved my books, he furnish'd me
       From mine own library with volumes that
       I prize above my dukedom. 280

     * Miranda. Would I might
       But ever see that man!

     * Prospero. Now I arise:
       [Resumes his mantle]
       Sit still, and hear the last of our sea-sorrow. 285
       Here in this island we arrived; and here
       Have I, thy schoolmaster, made thee more profit
       Than other princesses can that have more time
       For vainer hours and tutors not so careful.

     * Miranda. Heavens thank you for't! And now, I pray you, sir, 290
       For still 'tis beating in my mind, your reason
       For raising this sea-storm?

     * Prospero. Know thus far forth.
       By accident most strange, bountiful Fortune,
       Now my dear lady, hath mine enemies 295
       Brought to this shore; and by my prescience
       I find my zenith doth depend upon
       A most auspicious star, whose influence
       If now I court not but omit, my fortunes
       Will ever after droop. Here cease more questions: 300
       Thou art inclined to sleep; 'tis a good dulness,
       And give it way: I know thou canst not choose.
       [MIRANDA sleeps]
       Come away, servant, come. I am ready now.
       Approach, my Ariel, come. 305

   [Enter ARIEL]
     * Ariel. All hail, great master! grave sir, hail! I come
       To answer thy best pleasure; be't to fly,
       To swim, to dive into the fire, to ride
       On the curl'd clouds, to thy strong bidding task 310
       Ariel and all his quality.

     * Prospero. Hast thou, spirit,
       Perform'd to point the tempest that I bade thee?

     * Ariel. To every article.
       I boarded the king's ship; now on the beak, 315
       Now in the waist, the deck, in every cabin,
       I flamed amazement: sometime I'ld divide,
       And burn in many places; on the topmast,
       The yards and bowsprit, would I flame distinctly,
       Then meet and join. Jove's lightnings, the precursors 320
       O' the dreadful thunder-claps, more momentary
       And sight-outrunning were not; the fire and cracks
       Of sulphurous roaring the most mighty Neptune
       Seem to besiege and make his bold waves tremble,
       Yea, his dread trident shake. 325

     * Prospero. My brave spirit!
       Who was so firm, so constant, that this coil
       Would not infect his reason?

     * Ariel. Not a soul
       But felt a fever of the mad and play'd 330
       Some tricks of desperation. All but mariners
       Plunged in the foaming brine and quit the vessel,
       Then all afire with me: the king's son, Ferdinand,
       With hair up-staring,—then like reeds, not hair,—
       Was the first man that leap'd; cried, 'Hell is empty 335
       And all the devils are here.'

     * Prospero. Why that's my spirit!
       But was not this nigh shore?

     * Ariel. Close by, my master.

     * Prospero. But are they, Ariel, safe? 340

     * Ariel. Not a hair perish'd;
       On their sustaining garments not a blemish,
       But fresher than before: and, as thou badest me,
       In troops I have dispersed them 'bout the isle.
       The king's son have I landed by himself; 345
       Whom I left cooling of the air with sighs
       In an odd angle of the isle and sitting,
       His arms in this sad knot.

     * Prospero. Of the king's ship
       The mariners say how thou hast disposed 350
       And all the rest o' the fleet.

     * Ariel. Safely in harbour
       Is the king's ship; in the deep nook, where once
       Thou call'dst me up at midnight to fetch dew
       From the still-vex'd Bermoothes, there she's hid: 355
       The mariners all under hatches stow'd;
       Who, with a charm join'd to their suffer'd labour,
       I have left asleep; and for the rest o' the fleet
       Which I dispersed, they all have met again
       And are upon the Mediterranean flote, 360
       Bound sadly home for Naples,
       Supposing that they saw the king's ship wreck'd
       And his great person perish.

     * Prospero. Ariel, thy charge
       Exactly is perform'd: but there's more work. 365
       What is the time o' the day?

     * Ariel. Past the mid season.

     * Prospero. At least two glasses. The time 'twixt six and now
       Must by us both be spent most preciously.

     * Ariel. Is there more toil? Since thou dost give me pains, 370
       Let me remember thee what thou hast promised,
       Which is not yet perform'd me.

     * Prospero. How now? moody?
       What is't thou canst demand?

     * Ariel. My liberty. 375

     * Prospero. Before the time be out? no more!

     * Ariel. I prithee,
       Remember I have done thee worthy service;
       Told thee no lies, made thee no mistakings, served
       Without or grudge or grumblings: thou didst promise 380
       To bate me a full year.

     * Prospero. Dost thou forget
       From what a torment I did free thee?

     * Ariel. No.

     * Prospero. Thou dost, and think'st it much to tread the ooze 385
       Of the salt deep,
       To run upon the sharp wind of the north,
       To do me business in the veins o' the earth
       When it is baked with frost.

     * Ariel. I do not, sir. 390

     * Prospero. Thou liest, malignant thing! Hast thou forgot
       The foul witch Sycorax, who with age and envy
       Was grown into a hoop? hast thou forgot her?

     * Ariel. No, sir.

     * Prospero. Thou hast. Where was she born? speak; tell me. 395

     * Ariel. Sir, in Argier.

     * Prospero. O, was she so? I must
       Once in a month recount what thou hast been,
       Which thou forget'st. This damn'd witch Sycorax,
       For mischiefs manifold and sorceries terrible 400
       To enter human hearing, from Argier,
       Thou know'st, was banish'd: for one thing she did
       They would not take her life. Is not this true?

     * Ariel. Ay, sir.

     * Prospero. This blue-eyed hag was hither brought with child 405
       And here was left by the sailors. Thou, my slave,
       As thou report'st thyself, wast then her servant;
       And, for thou wast a spirit too delicate
       To act her earthy and abhorr'd commands,
       Refusing her grand hests, she did confine thee, 410
       By help of her more potent ministers
       And in her most unmitigable rage,
       Into a cloven pine; within which rift
       Imprison'd thou didst painfully remain
       A dozen years; within which space she died 415
       And left thee there; where thou didst vent thy groans
       As fast as mill-wheels strike. Then was this island—
       Save for the son that she did litter here,
       A freckled whelp hag-born—not honour'd with
       A human shape. 420

     * Ariel. Yes, Caliban her son.

     * Prospero. Dull thing, I say so; he, that Caliban
       Whom now I keep in service. Thou best know'st
       What torment I did find thee in; thy groans
       Did make wolves howl and penetrate the breasts 425
       Of ever angry bears: it was a torment
       To lay upon the damn'd, which Sycorax
       Could not again undo: it was mine art,
       When I arrived and heard thee, that made gape
       The pine and let thee out. 430

     * Ariel. I thank thee, master.

     * Prospero. If thou more murmur'st, I will rend an oak
       And peg thee in his knotty entrails till
       Thou hast howl'd away twelve winters.

     * Ariel. Pardon, master; 435
       I will be correspondent to command
       And do my spiriting gently.

     * Prospero. Do so, and after two days
       I will discharge thee.

     * Ariel. That's my noble master! 440
       What shall I do? say what; what shall I do?

     * Prospero. Go make thyself like a nymph o' the sea: be subject
       To no sight but thine and mine, invisible
       To every eyeball else. Go take this shape
       And hither come in't: go, hence with diligence! 445
       [Exit ARIEL]
       Awake, dear heart, awake! thou hast slept well; Awake!

     * Miranda. The strangeness of your story put
       Heaviness in me.

     * Prospero. Shake it off. Come on; 450
       We'll visit Caliban my slave, who never
       Yields us kind answer.

     * Miranda. 'Tis a villain, sir,
       I do not love to look on.

     * Prospero. But, as 'tis, 455
       We cannot miss him: he does make our fire,
       Fetch in our wood and serves in offices
       That profit us. What, ho! slave! Caliban!
       Thou earth, thou! speak.

     * Caliban. [Within] There's wood enough within. 460

     * Prospero. Come forth, I say! there's other business for thee:
       Come, thou tortoise! when?
       [Re-enter ARIEL like a water-nymph]
       Fine apparition! My quaint Ariel,
       Hark in thine ear. 465

     * Ariel. My lord it shall be done.

   [Exit]
     * Prospero. Thou poisonous slave, got by the devil himself
       Upon thy wicked dam, come forth!

   [Enter CALIBAN]
     * Caliban. As wicked dew as e'er my mother brush'd
       With raven's feather from unwholesome fen
       Drop on you both! a south-west blow on ye
       And blister you all o'er!

     * Prospero. For this, be sure, to-night thou shalt have cramps, 475
       Side-stitches that shall pen thy breath up; urchins
       Shall, for that vast of night that they may work,
       All exercise on thee; thou shalt be pinch'd
       As thick as honeycomb, each pinch more stinging
       Than bees that made 'em. 480

     * Caliban. I must eat my dinner.
       This island's mine, by Sycorax my mother,
       Which thou takest from me. When thou camest first,
       Thou strokedst me and madest much of me, wouldst give me
       Water with berries in't, and teach me how 485
       To name the bigger light, and how the less,
       That burn by day and night: and then I loved thee
       And show'd thee all the qualities o' the isle,
       The fresh springs, brine-pits, barren place and fertile:
       Cursed be I that did so! All the charms 490
       Of Sycorax, toads, beetles, bats, light on you!
       For I am all the subjects that you have,
       Which first was mine own king: and here you sty me
       In this hard rock, whiles you do keep from me
       The rest o' the island. 495

     * Prospero. Thou most lying slave,
       Whom stripes may move, not kindness! I have used thee,
       Filth as thou art, with human care, and lodged thee
       In mine own cell, till thou didst seek to violate
       The honour of my child. 500

     * Caliban. O ho, O ho! would't had been done!
       Thou didst prevent me; I had peopled else
       This isle with Calibans.

     * Prospero. Abhorred slave,
       Which any print of goodness wilt not take, 505
       Being capable of all ill! I pitied thee,
       Took pains to make thee speak, taught thee each hour
       One thing or other: when thou didst not, savage,
       Know thine own meaning, but wouldst gabble like
       A thing most brutish, I endow'd thy purposes 510
       With words that made them known. But thy vile race,
       Though thou didst learn, had that in't which
       good natures
       Could not abide to be with; therefore wast thou
       Deservedly confined into this rock, 515
       Who hadst deserved more than a prison.

     * Caliban. You taught me language; and my profit on't
       Is, I know how to curse. The red plague rid you
       For learning me your language!

     * Prospero. Hag-seed, hence! 520
       Fetch us in fuel; and be quick, thou'rt best,
       To answer other business. Shrug'st thou, malice?
       If thou neglect'st or dost unwillingly
       What I command, I'll rack thee with old cramps,
       Fill all thy bones with aches, make thee roar 525
       That beasts shall tremble at thy din.

     * Caliban. No, pray thee.
       [Aside]
       I must obey: his art is of such power,
       It would control my dam's god, Setebos, 530
       and make a vassal of him.

     * Prospero. So, slave; hence!
       [Exit CALIBAN]
       [Re-enter ARIEL, invisible, playing and singing;]
       FERDINAND following] 535
       ARIEL'S song.
       Come unto these yellow sands,
       And then take hands:
       Courtsied when you have and kiss'd
       The wild waves whist, 540
       Foot it featly here and there;
       And, sweet sprites, the burthen bear.
       Hark, hark!
       [Burthen [dispersedly, within] Bow-wow]
       The watch-dogs bark! 545
       [Burthen Bow-wow]
       Hark, hark! I hear
       The strain of strutting chanticleer
       Cry, Cock-a-diddle-dow.

     * Ferdinand. Where should this music be? i' the air or the earth? 550
       It sounds no more: and sure, it waits upon
       Some god o' the island. Sitting on a bank,
       Weeping again the king my father's wreck,
       This music crept by me upon the waters,
       Allaying both their fury and my passion 555
       With its sweet air: thence I have follow'd it,
       Or it hath drawn me rather. But 'tis gone.
       No, it begins again.
       [ARIEL sings]
       Full fathom five thy father lies; 560
       Of his bones are coral made;
       Those are pearls that were his eyes:
       Nothing of him that doth fade
       But doth suffer a sea-change
       Into something rich and strange. 565
       Sea-nymphs hourly ring his knell
       [Burthen Ding-dong]
       Hark! now I hear them,—Ding-dong, bell.

     * Ferdinand. The ditty does remember my drown'd father.
       This is no mortal business, nor no sound 570
       That the earth owes. I hear it now above me.

     * Prospero. The fringed curtains of thine eye advance
       And say what thou seest yond.

     * Miranda. What is't? a spirit?
       Lord, how it looks about! Believe me, sir, 575
       It carries a brave form. But 'tis a spirit.

     * Prospero. No, wench; it eats and sleeps and hath such senses
       As we have, such. This gallant which thou seest
       Was in the wreck; and, but he's something stain'd
       With grief that's beauty's canker, thou mightst call him 580
       A goodly person: he hath lost his fellows
       And strays about to find 'em.

     * Miranda. I might call him
       A thing divine, for nothing natural
       I ever saw so noble. 585

     * Prospero. [Aside] It goes on, I see,
       As my soul prompts it. Spirit, fine spirit! I'll free thee
       Within two days for this.

     * Ferdinand. Most sure, the goddess
       On whom these airs attend! Vouchsafe my prayer 590
       May know if you remain upon this island;
       And that you will some good instruction give
       How I may bear me here: my prime request,
       Which I do last pronounce, is, O you wonder!
       If you be maid or no? 595

     * Miranda. No wonder, sir;
       But certainly a maid.

     * Ferdinand. My language! heavens!
       I am the best of them that speak this speech,
       Were I but where 'tis spoken. 600

     * Prospero. How? the best?
       What wert thou, if the King of Naples heard thee?

     * Ferdinand. A single thing, as I am now, that wonders
       To hear thee speak of Naples. He does hear me;
       And that he does I weep: myself am Naples, 605
       Who with mine eyes, never since at ebb, beheld
       The king my father wreck'd.

     * Miranda. Alack, for mercy!

     * Ferdinand. Yes, faith, and all his lords; the Duke of Milan
       And his brave son being twain. 610

     * Prospero. [Aside]. The Duke of Milan
       And his more braver daughter could control thee,
       If now 'twere fit to do't. At the first sight
       They have changed eyes. Delicate Ariel,
       I'll set thee free for this. 615
       [To FERDINAND]
       A word, good sir;
       I fear you have done yourself some wrong: a word.

     * Miranda. Why speaks my father so ungently? This
       Is the third man that e'er I saw, the first 620
       That e'er I sigh'd for: pity move my father
       To be inclined my way!

     * Ferdinand. O, if a virgin,
       And your affection not gone forth, I'll make you
       The queen of Naples. 625

     * Prospero. Soft, sir! one word more.
       [Aside]
       They are both in either's powers; but this swift business
       I must uneasy make, lest too light winning
       Make the prize light. 630
       [To FERDINAND]
       One word more; I charge thee
       That thou attend me: thou dost here usurp
       The name thou owest not; and hast put thyself
       Upon this island as a spy, to win it 635
       From me, the lord on't.

     * Ferdinand. No, as I am a man.

     * Miranda. There's nothing ill can dwell in such a temple:
       If the ill spirit have so fair a house,
       Good things will strive to dwell with't. 640

     * Prospero. Follow me.
       Speak not you for him; he's a traitor. Come;
       I'll manacle thy neck and feet together:
       Sea-water shalt thou drink; thy food shall be
       The fresh-brook muscles, wither'd roots and husks 645
       Wherein the acorn cradled. Follow.

     * Ferdinand. No;
       I will resist such entertainment till
       Mine enemy has more power.

   [Draws, and is charmed from moving]
     * Miranda. O dear father,
       Make not too rash a trial of him, for
       He's gentle and not fearful.

     * Prospero. What? I say,
       My foot my tutor? Put thy sword up, traitor; 655
       Who makest a show but darest not strike, thy conscience
       Is so possess'd with guilt: come from thy ward,
       For I can here disarm thee with this stick
       And make thy weapon drop.

     * Miranda. Beseech you, father. 660

     * Prospero. Hence! hang not on my garments.

     * Miranda. Sir, have pity;
       I'll be his surety.

     * Prospero. Silence! one word more
       Shall make me chide thee, if not hate thee. What! 665
       An advocate for an imposter! hush!
       Thou think'st there is no more such shapes as he,
       Having seen but him and Caliban: foolish wench!
       To the most of men this is a Caliban
       And they to him are angels. 670

     * Miranda. My affections
       Are then most humble; I have no ambition
       To see a goodlier man.

     * Prospero. Come on; obey:
       Thy nerves are in their infancy again 675
       And have no vigour in them.

     * Ferdinand. So they are;
       My spirits, as in a dream, are all bound up.
       My father's loss, the weakness which I feel,
       The wreck of all my friends, nor this man's threats, 680
       To whom I am subdued, are but light to me,
       Might I but through my prison once a day
       Behold this maid: all corners else o' the earth
       Let liberty make use of; space enough
       Have I in such a prison. 685

     * Prospero. [Aside] It works.
       [To FERDINAND]
       Come on.
       Thou hast done well, fine Ariel!
       [To FERDINAND] 690
       Follow me.
       [To ARIEL]
       Hark what thou else shalt do me.

     * Miranda. Be of comfort;
       My father's of a better nature, sir, 695
       Than he appears by speech: this is unwonted
       Which now came from him.

     * Prospero. Thou shalt be free
       As mountain winds: but then exactly do
       All points of my command. 700

     * Ariel. To the syllable.

     * Prospero. Come, follow. Speak not for him.

   [Exeunt]

   Act II, Scene 1

   Another part of the island.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   [Enter ALONSO, SEBASTIAN, ANTONIO, GONZALO,] [p]ADRIAN, FRANCISCO, and
   others]
     * Gonzalo. Beseech you, sir, be merry; you have cause,
       So have we all, of joy; for our escape
       Is much beyond our loss. Our hint of woe
       Is common; every day some sailor's wife,
       The masters of some merchant and the merchant 710
       Have just our theme of woe; but for the miracle,
       I mean our preservation, few in millions
       Can speak like us: then wisely, good sir, weigh
       Our sorrow with our comfort.

     * Alonso. Prithee, peace. 715

     * Sebastian. He receives comfort like cold porridge.

     * Antonio. The visitor will not give him o'er so.

     * Sebastian. Look he's winding up the watch of his wit;
       by and by it will strike.

     * Gonzalo. Sir,— 720

     * Sebastian. One: tell.

     * Gonzalo. When every grief is entertain'd that's offer'd,
       Comes to the entertainer—

     * Sebastian. A dollar.

     * Gonzalo. Dolour comes to him, indeed: you 725
       have spoken truer than you purposed.

     * Sebastian. You have taken it wiselier than I meant you should.

     * Gonzalo. Therefore, my lord,—

     * Antonio. Fie, what a spendthrift is he of his tongue!

     * Alonso. I prithee, spare. 730

     * Gonzalo. Well, I have done: but yet,—

     * Sebastian. He will be talking.

     * Antonio. Which, of he or Adrian, for a good
       wager, first begins to crow?

     * Sebastian. The old cock. 735

     * Antonio. The cockerel.

     * Sebastian. Done. The wager?

     * Antonio. A laughter.

     * Sebastian. A match!

     * Adrian. Though this island seem to be desert,— 740

     * Sebastian. Ha, ha, ha! So, you're paid.

     * Adrian. Uninhabitable and almost inaccessible,—

     * Sebastian. Yet,—

     * Adrian. Yet,—

     * Antonio. He could not miss't. 745

     * Adrian. It must needs be of subtle, tender and delicate
       temperance.

     * Antonio. Temperance was a delicate wench.

     * Sebastian. Ay, and a subtle; as he most learnedly delivered.

     * Adrian. The air breathes upon us here most sweetly. 750

     * Sebastian. As if it had lungs and rotten ones.

     * Antonio. Or as 'twere perfumed by a fen.

     * Gonzalo. Here is everything advantageous to life.

     * Antonio. True; save means to live.

     * Sebastian. Of that there's none, or little. 755

     * Gonzalo. How lush and lusty the grass looks! how green!

     * Antonio. The ground indeed is tawny.

     * Sebastian. With an eye of green in't.

     * Antonio. He misses not much.

     * Sebastian. No; he doth but mistake the truth totally. 760

     * Gonzalo. But the rarity of it is,—which is indeed almost
       beyond credit,—

     * Sebastian. As many vouched rarities are.

     * Gonzalo. That our garments, being, as they were, drenched in
       the sea, hold notwithstanding their freshness and 765
       glosses, being rather new-dyed than stained with
       salt water.

     * Antonio. If but one of his pockets could speak, would it not
       say he lies?

     * Sebastian. Ay, or very falsely pocket up his report 770

     * Gonzalo. Methinks our garments are now as fresh as when we
       put them on first in Afric, at the marriage of
       the king's fair daughter Claribel to the King of Tunis.

     * Sebastian. 'Twas a sweet marriage, and we prosper well in our
       return.

     * Adrian. Tunis was never graced before with such a paragon to 775
       their queen.

     * Gonzalo. Not since widow Dido's time.

     * Antonio. Widow! a pox o' that! How came that widow in?
       widow Dido!

     * Sebastian. What if he had said 'widower AEneas' too? Good Lord, 780
       how you take it!

     * Adrian. 'Widow Dido' said you? you make me study of that:
       she was of Carthage, not of Tunis.

     * Gonzalo. This Tunis, sir, was Carthage.

     * Adrian. Carthage? 785

     * Gonzalo. I assure you, Carthage.

     * Sebastian. His word is more than the miraculous harp; he hath
       raised the wall and houses too.

     * Antonio. What impossible matter will he make easy next?

     * Sebastian. I think he will carry this island home in his pocket 790
       and give it his son for an apple.

     * Antonio. And, sowing the kernels of it in the sea, bring
       forth more islands.

     * Gonzalo. Ay.

     * Antonio. Why, in good time. 795

     * Gonzalo. Sir, we were talking that our garments seem now
       as fresh as when we were at Tunis at the marriage
       of your daughter, who is now queen.

     * Antonio. And the rarest that e'er came there.

     * Sebastian. Bate, I beseech you, widow Dido. 800

     * Antonio. O, widow Dido! ay, widow Dido.

     * Gonzalo. Is not, sir, my doublet as fresh as the first day I
       wore it? I mean, in a sort.

     * Antonio. That sort was well fished for.

     * Gonzalo. When I wore it at your daughter's marriage? 805

     * Alonso. You cram these words into mine ears against
       The stomach of my sense. Would I had never
       Married my daughter there! for, coming thence,
       My son is lost and, in my rate, she too,
       Who is so far from Italy removed 810
       I ne'er again shall see her. O thou mine heir
       Of Naples and of Milan, what strange fish
       Hath made his meal on thee?

     * Francisco. Sir, he may live:
       I saw him beat the surges under him, 815
       And ride upon their backs; he trod the water,
       Whose enmity he flung aside, and breasted
       The surge most swoln that met him; his bold head
       'Bove the contentious waves he kept, and oar'd
       Himself with his good arms in lusty stroke 820
       To the shore, that o'er his wave-worn basis bow'd,
       As stooping to relieve him: I not doubt
       He came alive to land.

     * Alonso. No, no, he's gone.

     * Sebastian. Sir, you may thank yourself for this great loss, 825
       That would not bless our Europe with your daughter,
       But rather lose her to an African;
       Where she at least is banish'd from your eye,
       Who hath cause to wet the grief on't.

     * Alonso. Prithee, peace. 830

     * Sebastian. You were kneel'd to and importuned otherwise
       By all of us, and the fair soul herself
       Weigh'd between loathness and obedience, at
       Which end o' the beam should bow. We have lost your
       son, 835
       I fear, for ever: Milan and Naples have
       More widows in them of this business' making
       Than we bring men to comfort them:
       The fault's your own.

     * Alonso. So is the dear'st o' the loss. 840

     * Gonzalo. My lord Sebastian,
       The truth you speak doth lack some gentleness
       And time to speak it in: you rub the sore,
       When you should bring the plaster.

     * Sebastian. Very well. 845

     * Antonio. And most chirurgeonly.

     * Gonzalo. It is foul weather in us all, good sir,
       When you are cloudy.

     * Sebastian. Foul weather?

     * Antonio. Very foul. 850

     * Gonzalo. Had I plantation of this isle, my lord,—

     * Antonio. He'ld sow't with nettle-seed.

     * Sebastian. Or docks, or mallows.

     * Gonzalo. And were the king on't, what would I do?

     * Sebastian. 'Scape being drunk for want of wine. 855

     * Gonzalo. I' the commonwealth I would by contraries
       Execute all things; for no kind of traffic
       Would I admit; no name of magistrate;
       Letters should not be known; riches, poverty,
       And use of service, none; contract, succession, 860
       Bourn, bound of land, tilth, vineyard, none;
       No use of metal, corn, or wine, or oil;
       No occupation; all men idle, all;
       And women too, but innocent and pure;
       No sovereignty;— 865

     * Sebastian. Yet he would be king on't.

     * Antonio. The latter end of his commonwealth forgets the
       beginning.

     * Gonzalo. All things in common nature should produce
       Without sweat or endeavour: treason, felony, 870
       Sword, pike, knife, gun, or need of any engine,
       Would I not have; but nature should bring forth,
       Of its own kind, all foison, all abundance,
       To feed my innocent people.

     * Sebastian. No marrying 'mong his subjects? 875

     * Antonio. None, man; all idle: whores and knaves.

     * Gonzalo. I would with such perfection govern, sir,
       To excel the golden age.

     * Sebastian. God save his majesty!

     * Antonio. Long live Gonzalo! 880

     * Gonzalo. And,—do you mark me, sir?

     * Alonso. Prithee, no more: thou dost talk nothing to me.

     * Gonzalo. I do well believe your highness; and
       did it to minister occasion to these gentlemen,
       who are of such sensible and nimble lungs that 885
       they always use to laugh at nothing.

     * Antonio. 'Twas you we laughed at.

     * Gonzalo. Who in this kind of merry fooling am nothing
       to you: so you may continue and laugh at
       nothing still. 890

     * Antonio. What a blow was there given!

     * Sebastian. An it had not fallen flat-long.

     * Gonzalo. You are gentlemen of brave metal; you would lift
       the moon out of her sphere, if she would continue
       in it five weeks without changing. 895

   [Enter ARIEL, invisible, playing solemn music]
     * Sebastian. We would so, and then go a bat-fowling.

     * Antonio. Nay, good my lord, be not angry.

     * Gonzalo. No, I warrant you; I will not adventure
       my discretion so weakly. Will you laugh 900
       me asleep, for I am very heavy?

     * Antonio. Go sleep, and hear us.

   [All sleep except ALONSO, SEBASTIAN, and ANTONIO]
     * Alonso. What, all so soon asleep! I wish mine eyes
       Would, with themselves, shut up my thoughts: I find 905
       They are inclined to do so.

     * Sebastian. Please you, sir,
       Do not omit the heavy offer of it:
       It seldom visits sorrow; when it doth,
       It is a comforter. 910

     * Antonio. We two, my lord,
       Will guard your person while you take your rest,
       And watch your safety.

     * Alonso. Thank you. Wondrous heavy.

   [ALONSO sleeps. Exit ARIEL]
     * Sebastian. What a strange drowsiness possesses them!

     * Antonio. It is the quality o' the climate.

     * Sebastian. Why
       Doth it not then our eyelids sink? I find not
       Myself disposed to sleep. 920

     * Antonio. Nor I; my spirits are nimble.
       They fell together all, as by consent;
       They dropp'd, as by a thunder-stroke. What might,
       Worthy Sebastian? O, what might?—No more:—
       And yet me thinks I see it in thy face, 925
       What thou shouldst be: the occasion speaks thee, and
       My strong imagination sees a crown
       Dropping upon thy head.

     * Sebastian. What, art thou waking?

     * Antonio. Do you not hear me speak? 930

     * Sebastian. I do; and surely
       It is a sleepy language and thou speak'st
       Out of thy sleep. What is it thou didst say?
       This is a strange repose, to be asleep
       With eyes wide open; standing, speaking, moving, 935
       And yet so fast asleep.

     * Antonio. Noble Sebastian,
       Thou let'st thy fortune sleep—die, rather; wink'st
       Whiles thou art waking.

     * Sebastian. Thou dost snore distinctly; 940
       There's meaning in thy snores.

     * Antonio. I am more serious than my custom: you
       Must be so too, if heed me; which to do
       Trebles thee o'er.

     * Sebastian. Well, I am standing water. 945

     * Antonio. I'll teach you how to flow.

     * Sebastian. Do so: to ebb
       Hereditary sloth instructs me.

     * Antonio. O,
       If you but knew how you the purpose cherish 950
       Whiles thus you mock it! how, in stripping it,
       You more invest it! Ebbing men, indeed,
       Most often do so near the bottom run
       By their own fear or sloth.

     * Sebastian. Prithee, say on: 955
       The setting of thine eye and cheek proclaim
       A matter from thee, and a birth indeed
       Which throes thee much to yield.

     * Antonio. Thus, sir:
       Although this lord of weak remembrance, this, 960
       Who shall be of as little memory
       When he is earth'd, hath here almost persuade,—
       For he's a spirit of persuasion, only
       Professes to persuade,—the king his son's alive,
       'Tis as impossible that he's undrown'd 965
       And he that sleeps here swims.

     * Sebastian. I have no hope
       That he's undrown'd.

     * Antonio. O, out of that 'no hope'
       What great hope have you! no hope that way is 970
       Another way so high a hope that even
       Ambition cannot pierce a wink beyond,
       But doubt discovery there. Will you grant with me
       That Ferdinand is drown'd?

     * Sebastian. He's gone. 975

     * Antonio. Then, tell me,
       Who's the next heir of Naples?

     * Sebastian. Claribel.

     * Antonio. She that is queen of Tunis; she that dwells
       Ten leagues beyond man's life; she that from Naples 980
       Can have no note, unless the sun were post—
       The man i' the moon's too slow—till new-born chins
       Be rough and razorable; she that—from whom?
       We all were sea-swallow'd, though some cast again,
       And by that destiny to perform an act 985
       Whereof what's past is prologue, what to come
       In yours and my discharge.

     * Sebastian. What stuff is this! how say you?
       'Tis true, my brother's daughter's queen of Tunis;
       So is she heir of Naples; 'twixt which regions 990
       There is some space.

     * Antonio. A space whose every cubit
       Seems to cry out, 'How shall that Claribel
       Measure us back to Naples? Keep in Tunis,
       And let Sebastian wake.' Say, this were death 995
       That now hath seized them; why, they were no worse
       Than now they are. There be that can rule Naples
       As well as he that sleeps; lords that can prate
       As amply and unnecessarily
       As this Gonzalo; I myself could make 1000
       A chough of as deep chat. O, that you bore
       The mind that I do! what a sleep were this
       For your advancement! Do you understand me?

     * Sebastian. Methinks I do.

     * Antonio. And how does your content 1005
       Tender your own good fortune?

     * Sebastian. I remember
       You did supplant your brother Prospero.

     * Antonio. True:
       And look how well my garments sit upon me; 1010
       Much feater than before: my brother's servants
       Were then my fellows; now they are my men.

     * Sebastian. But, for your conscience?

     * Antonio. Ay, sir; where lies that? if 'twere a kibe,
       'Twould put me to my slipper: but I feel not 1015
       This deity in my bosom: twenty consciences,
       That stand 'twixt me and Milan, candied be they
       And melt ere they molest! Here lies your brother,
       No better than the earth he lies upon,
       If he were that which now he's like, that's dead; 1020
       Whom I, with this obedient steel, three inches of it,
       Can lay to bed for ever; whiles you, doing thus,
       To the perpetual wink for aye might put
       This ancient morsel, this Sir Prudence, who
       Should not upbraid our course. For all the rest, 1025
       They'll take suggestion as a cat laps milk;
       They'll tell the clock to any business that
       We say befits the hour.

     * Sebastian. Thy case, dear friend,
       Shall be my precedent; as thou got'st Milan, 1030
       I'll come by Naples. Draw thy sword: one stroke
       Shall free thee from the tribute which thou payest;
       And I the king shall love thee.

     * Antonio. Draw together;
       And when I rear my hand, do you the like, 1035
       To fall it on Gonzalo.

     * Sebastian. O, but one word.

   [They talk apart]

   [Re-enter ARIEL, invisible]
     * Ariel. My master through his art foresees the danger 1040
       That you, his friend, are in; and sends me forth—
       For else his project dies—to keep them living.
       [Sings in GONZALO's ear]
       While you here do snoring lie,
       Open-eyed conspiracy 1045
       His time doth take.
       If of life you keep a care,
       Shake off slumber, and beware:
       Awake, awake!

     * Antonio. Then let us both be sudden. 1050

     * Gonzalo. Now, good angels
       Preserve the king.

   [They wake]
     * Alonso. Why, how now? ho, awake! Why are you drawn?
       Wherefore this ghastly looking? 1055

     * Gonzalo. What's the matter?

     * Sebastian. Whiles we stood here securing your repose,
       Even now, we heard a hollow burst of bellowing
       Like bulls, or rather lions: did't not wake you?
       It struck mine ear most terribly. 1060

     * Alonso. I heard nothing.

     * Antonio. O, 'twas a din to fright a monster's ear,
       To make an earthquake! sure, it was the roar
       Of a whole herd of lions.

     * Alonso. Heard you this, Gonzalo? 1065

     * Gonzalo. Upon mine honour, sir, I heard a humming,
       And that a strange one too, which did awake me:
       I shaked you, sir, and cried: as mine eyes open'd,
       I saw their weapons drawn: there was a noise,
       That's verily. 'Tis best we stand upon our guard, 1070
       Or that we quit this place; let's draw our weapons.

     * Alonso. Lead off this ground; and let's make further search
       For my poor son.

     * Gonzalo. Heavens keep him from these beasts!
       For he is, sure, i' the island. 1075

     * Alonso. Lead away.

     * Ariel. Prospero my lord shall know what I have done:
       So, king, go safely on to seek thy son.

   [Exeunt]

   Act II, Scene 2

   Another part of the island.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   [Enter CALIBAN with a burden of wood. A noise of] [p]thunder heard]
     * Caliban. All the infections that the sun sucks up
       From bogs, fens, flats, on Prosper fall and make him
       By inch-meal a disease! His spirits hear me
       And yet I needs must curse. But they'll nor pinch, 1085
       Fright me with urchin—shows, pitch me i' the mire,
       Nor lead me, like a firebrand, in the dark
       Out of my way, unless he bid 'em; but
       For every trifle are they set upon me;
       Sometime like apes that mow and chatter at me 1090
       And after bite me, then like hedgehogs which
       Lie tumbling in my barefoot way and mount
       Their pricks at my footfall; sometime am I
       All wound with adders who with cloven tongues
       Do hiss me into madness. 1095
       [Enter TRINCULO]
       Lo, now, lo!
       Here comes a spirit of his, and to torment me
       For bringing wood in slowly. I'll fall flat;
       Perchance he will not mind me. 1100

     * Trinculo. Here's neither bush nor shrub, to bear off
       any weather at all, and another storm brewing;
       I hear it sing i' the wind: yond same black
       cloud, yond huge one, looks like a foul
       bombard that would shed his liquor. If it 1105
       should thunder as it did before, I know not
       where to hide my head: yond same cloud cannot
       choose but fall by pailfuls. What have we
       here? a man or a fish? dead or alive? A fish:
       he smells like a fish; a very ancient and fish- 1110
       like smell; a kind of not of the newest Poor-
       John. A strange fish! Were I in England now,
       as once I was, and had but this fish painted,
       not a holiday fool there but would give a piece
       of silver: there would this monster make a 1115
       man; any strange beast there makes a man:
       when they will not give a doit to relieve a lame
       beggar, they will lazy out ten to see a dead
       Indian. Legged like a man and his fins like
       arms! Warm o' my troth! I do now let loose 1120
       my opinion; hold it no longer: this is no fish,
       but an islander, that hath lately suffered by a
       thunderbolt.
       [Thunder]
       Alas, the storm is come again! my best way is to 1125
       creep under his gaberdine; there is no other
       shelter hereabouts: misery acquaints a man with
       strange bed-fellows. I will here shroud till the
       dregs of the storm be past.

   [Enter STEPHANO, singing: a bottle in his hand]
     * Stephano. I shall no more to sea, to sea,
       Here shall I die ashore—
       This is a very scurvy tune to sing at a man's
       funeral: well, here's my comfort. [Drinks]
       [Sings] 1135
       The master, the swabber, the boatswain and I,
       The gunner and his mate
       Loved Mall, Meg and Marian and Margery,
       But none of us cared for Kate;
       For she had a tongue with a tang, 1140
       Would cry to a sailor, Go hang!
       She loved not the savour of tar nor of pitch,
       Yet a tailor might scratch her where'er she did itch:
       Then to sea, boys, and let her go hang!
       This is a scurvy tune too: but here's my comfort. 1145

   [Drinks]
     * Caliban. Do not torment me: Oh!

     * Stephano. What's the matter? Have we devils here? Do you put
       tricks upon's with savages and men of Ind, ha? I
       have not scaped drowning to be afeard now of your 1150
       four legs; for it hath been said, As proper a man as
       ever went on four legs cannot make him give ground;
       and it shall be said so again while Stephano
       breathes at's nostrils.

     * Caliban. The spirit torments me; Oh! 1155

     * Stephano. This is some monster of the isle with four legs, who
       hath got, as I take it, an ague. Where the devil
       should he learn our language? I will give him some
       relief, if it be but for that. if I can recover him
       and keep him tame and get to Naples with him, he's a 1160
       present for any emperor that ever trod on neat's leather.

     * Caliban. Do not torment me, prithee; I'll bring my wood home
       faster.

     * Stephano. He's in his fit now and does not talk after the
       wisest. He shall taste of my bottle: if he have
       never drunk wine afore will go near to remove his 1165
       fit. If I can recover him and keep him tame, I will
       not take too much for him; he shall pay for him that
       hath him, and that soundly.

     * Caliban. Thou dost me yet but little hurt; thou wilt anon, I
       know it by thy trembling: now Prosper works upon thee. 1170

     * Stephano. Come on your ways; open your mouth; here is that
       which will give language to you, cat: open your
       mouth; this will shake your shaking, I can tell you,
       and that soundly: you cannot tell who's your friend:
       open your chaps again. 1175

     * Trinculo. I should know that voice: it should be—but he is
       drowned; and these are devils: O defend me!

     * Stephano. Four legs and two voices: a most delicate monster!
       His forward voice now is to speak well of his
       friend; his backward voice is to utter foul speeches 1180
       and to detract. If all the wine in my bottle will
       recover him, I will help his ague. Come. Amen! I
       will pour some in thy other mouth.

     * Trinculo. Stephano!

     * Stephano. Doth thy other mouth call me? Mercy, mercy! This is 1185
       a devil, and no monster: I will leave him; I have no
       long spoon.

     * Trinculo. Stephano! If thou beest Stephano, touch me and
       speak to me: for I am Trinculo—be not afeard—thy
       good friend Trinculo. 1190

     * Stephano. If thou beest Trinculo, come forth: I'll pull thee
       by the lesser legs: if any be Trinculo's legs,
       these are they. Thou art very Trinculo indeed! How
       camest thou to be the siege of this moon-calf? can
       he vent Trinculos? 1195

     * Trinculo. I took him to be killed with a thunder-stroke. But
       art thou not drowned, Stephano? I hope now thou art
       not drowned. Is the storm overblown? I hid me
       under the dead moon-calf's gaberdine for fear of
       the storm. And art thou living, Stephano? O 1200
       Stephano, two Neapolitans 'scaped!

     * Stephano. Prithee, do not turn me about; my stomach is not
       constant.

     * Caliban. [Aside] These be fine things, an if they be
       not sprites.
       That's a brave god and bears celestial liquor. 1205
       I will kneel to him.

     * Stephano. How didst thou 'scape? How camest thou hither?
       swear by this bottle how thou camest hither. I
       escaped upon a butt of sack which the sailors
       heaved o'erboard, by this bottle; which I made of 1210
       the bark of a tree with mine own hands since I was
       cast ashore.

     * Caliban. I'll swear upon that bottle to be thy true subject;
       for the liquor is not earthly.

     * Stephano. Here; swear then how thou escapedst. 1215

     * Trinculo. Swum ashore. man, like a duck: I can swim like a
       duck, I'll be sworn.

     * Stephano. Here, kiss the book. Though thou canst swim like a
       duck, thou art made like a goose.

     * Trinculo. O Stephano. hast any more of this? 1220

     * Stephano. The whole butt, man: my cellar is in a rock by the
       sea-side where my wine is hid. How now, moon-calf!
       how does thine ague?

     * Caliban. Hast thou not dropp'd from heaven?

     * Stephano. Out o' the moon, I do assure thee: I was the man i' 1225
       the moon when time was.

     * Caliban. I have seen thee in her and I do adore thee:
       My mistress show'd me thee and thy dog and thy bush.

     * Stephano. Come, swear to that; kiss the book: I will furnish
       it anon with new contents swear. 1230

     * Trinculo. By this good light, this is a very shallow monster!
       I afeard of him! A very weak monster! The man i'
       the moon! A most poor credulous monster! Well
       drawn, monster, in good sooth!

     * Caliban. I'll show thee every fertile inch o' th' island; 1235
       And I will kiss thy foot: I prithee, be my god.

     * Trinculo. By this light, a most perfidious and drunken
       monster! when 's god's asleep, he'll rob his bottle.

     * Caliban. I'll kiss thy foot; I'll swear myself thy subject.

     * Stephano. Come on then; down, and swear. 1240

     * Trinculo. I shall laugh myself to death at this puppy-headed
       monster. A most scurvy monster! I could find in my
       heart to beat him,—

     * Stephano. Come, kiss.

     * Trinculo. But that the poor monster's in drink: an abominable
       monster! 1245

     * Caliban. I'll show thee the best springs; I'll pluck thee berries;
       I'll fish for thee and get thee wood enough.
       A plague upon the tyrant that I serve!
       I'll bear him no more sticks, but follow thee,
       Thou wondrous man. 1250

     * Trinculo. A most ridiculous monster, to make a wonder of a
       Poor drunkard!

     * Caliban. I prithee, let me bring thee where crabs grow;
       And I with my long nails will dig thee pignuts;
       Show thee a jay's nest and instruct thee how 1255
       To snare the nimble marmoset; I'll bring thee
       To clustering filberts and sometimes I'll get thee
       Young scamels from the rock. Wilt thou go with me?

     * Stephano. I prithee now, lead the way without any more
       talking. Trinculo, the king and all our company 1260
       else being drowned, we will inherit here: here;
       bear my bottle: fellow Trinculo, we'll fill him by
       and by again.

     * Caliban. [Sings drunkenly]
       Farewell master; farewell, farewell! 1265

     * Trinculo. A howling monster: a drunken monster!

     * Caliban. No more dams I'll make for fish
       Nor fetch in firing
       At requiring;
       Nor scrape trencher, nor wash dish 1270
       'Ban, 'Ban, Cacaliban
       Has a new master: get a new man.
       Freedom, hey-day! hey-day, freedom! freedom,
       hey-day, freedom!

     * Stephano. O brave monster! Lead the way. 1275

   Act III, Scene 1

   Before PROSPERO’S Cell.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   [Enter FERDINAND, bearing a log]
     * Ferdinand. There be some sports are painful, and their labour
       Delight in them sets off: some kinds of baseness
       Are nobly undergone and most poor matters 1280
       Point to rich ends. This my mean task
       Would be as heavy to me as odious, but
       The mistress which I serve quickens what's dead
       And makes my labours pleasures: O, she is
       Ten times more gentle than her father's crabbed, 1285
       And he's composed of harshness. I must remove
       Some thousands of these logs and pile them up,
       Upon a sore injunction: my sweet mistress
       Weeps when she sees me work, and says, such baseness
       Had never like executor. I forget: 1290
       But these sweet thoughts do even refresh my labours,
       Most busy lest, when I do it.

   [Enter MIRANDA; and PROSPERO at a distance, unseen]
     * Miranda. Alas, now, pray you,
       Work not so hard: I would the lightning had 1295
       Burnt up those logs that you are enjoin'd to pile!
       Pray, set it down and rest you: when this burns,
       'Twill weep for having wearied you. My father
       Is hard at study; pray now, rest yourself;
       He's safe for these three hours. 1300

     * Ferdinand. O most dear mistress,
       The sun will set before I shall discharge
       What I must strive to do.

     * Miranda. If you'll sit down,
       I'll bear your logs the while: pray, give me that; 1305
       I'll carry it to the pile.

     * Ferdinand. No, precious creature;
       I had rather crack my sinews, break my back,
       Than you should such dishonour undergo,
       While I sit lazy by. 1310

     * Miranda. It would become me
       As well as it does you: and I should do it
       With much more ease; for my good will is to it,
       And yours it is against.

     * Prospero. Poor worm, thou art infected! 1315
       This visitation shows it.

     * Miranda. You look wearily.

     * Ferdinand. No, noble mistress;'tis fresh morning with me
       When you are by at night. I do beseech you—
       Chiefly that I might set it in my prayers— 1320
       What is your name?

     * Miranda. Miranda.—O my father,
       I have broke your hest to say so!

     * Ferdinand. Admired Miranda!
       Indeed the top of admiration! worth 1325
       What's dearest to the world! Full many a lady
       I have eyed with best regard and many a time
       The harmony of their tongues hath into bondage
       Brought my too diligent ear: for several virtues
       Have I liked several women; never any 1330
       With so fun soul, but some defect in her
       Did quarrel with the noblest grace she owed
       And put it to the foil: but you, O you,
       So perfect and so peerless, are created
       Of every creature's best! 1335

     * Miranda. I do not know
       One of my sex; no woman's face remember,
       Save, from my glass, mine own; nor have I seen
       More that I may call men than you, good friend,
       And my dear father: how features are abroad, 1340
       I am skilless of; but, by my modesty,
       The jewel in my dower, I would not wish
       Any companion in the world but you,
       Nor can imagination form a shape,
       Besides yourself, to like of. But I prattle 1345
       Something too wildly and my father's precepts
       I therein do forget.

     * Ferdinand. I am in my condition
       A prince, Miranda; I do think, a king;
       I would, not so!—and would no more endure 1350
       This wooden slavery than to suffer
       The flesh-fly blow my mouth. Hear my soul speak:
       The very instant that I saw you, did
       My heart fly to your service; there resides,
       To make me slave to it; and for your sake 1355
       Am I this patient log—man.

     * Miranda. Do you love me?

     * Ferdinand. O heaven, O earth, bear witness to this sound
       And crown what I profess with kind event
       If I speak true! if hollowly, invert 1360
       What best is boded me to mischief! I
       Beyond all limit of what else i' the world
       Do love, prize, honour you.

     * Miranda. I am a fool
       To weep at what I am glad of. 1365

     * Prospero. Fair encounter
       Of two most rare affections! Heavens rain grace
       On that which breeds between 'em!

     * Ferdinand. Wherefore weep you?

     * Miranda. At mine unworthiness that dare not offer 1370
       What I desire to give, and much less take
       What I shall die to want. But this is trifling;
       And all the more it seeks to hide itself,
       The bigger bulk it shows. Hence, bashful cunning!
       And prompt me, plain and holy innocence! 1375
       I am your wife, it you will marry me;
       If not, I'll die your maid: to be your fellow
       You may deny me; but I'll be your servant,
       Whether you will or no.

     * Ferdinand. My mistress, dearest; 1380
       And I thus humble ever.

     * Miranda. My husband, then?

     * Ferdinand. Ay, with a heart as willing
       As bondage e'er of freedom: here's my hand.

     * Miranda. And mine, with my heart in't; and now farewell 1385
       Till half an hour hence.

     * Ferdinand. A thousand thousand!

   [Exeunt FERDINAND and MIRANDA severally]
     * Prospero. So glad of this as they I cannot be,
       Who are surprised withal; but my rejoicing 1390
       At nothing can be more. I'll to my book,
       For yet ere supper-time must I perform
       Much business appertaining.

   [Exit]

   Act III, Scene 2

   Another part of the island.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   [Enter CALIBAN, STEPHANO, and TRINCULO]
     * Stephano. Tell not me; when the butt is out, we will drink
       water; not a drop before: therefore bear up, and
       board 'em. Servant-monster, drink to me.

     * Trinculo. Servant-monster! the folly of this island! They
       say there's but five upon this isle: we are three 1400
       of them; if th' other two be brained like us, the
       state totters.

     * Stephano. Drink, servant-monster, when I bid thee: thy eyes
       are almost set in thy head.

     * Trinculo. Where should they be set else? he were a brave 1405
       monster indeed, if they were set in his tail.

     * Stephano. My man-monster hath drown'd his tongue in sack:
       for my part, the sea cannot drown me; I swam, ere I
       could recover the shore, five and thirty leagues off
       and on. By this light, thou shalt be my lieutenant, 1410
       monster, or my standard.

     * Trinculo. Your lieutenant, if you list; he's no standard.

     * Stephano. We'll not run, Monsieur Monster.

     * Trinculo. Nor go neither; but you'll lie like dogs and yet say
       nothing neither. 1415

     * Stephano. Moon-calf, speak once in thy life, if thou beest a
       good moon-calf.

     * Caliban. How does thy honour? Let me lick thy shoe.
       I'll not serve him; he's not valiant.

     * Trinculo. Thou liest, most ignorant monster: I am in case to 1420
       justle a constable. Why, thou deboshed fish thou,
       was there ever man a coward that hath drunk so much
       sack as I to-day? Wilt thou tell a monstrous lie,
       being but half a fish and half a monster?

     * Caliban. Lo, how he mocks me! wilt thou let him, my lord? 1425

     * Trinculo. 'Lord' quoth he! That a monster should be such a natural!

     * Caliban. Lo, lo, again! bite him to death, I prithee.

     * Stephano. Trinculo, keep a good tongue in your head: if you
       prove a mutineer,—the next tree! The poor monster's
       my subject and he shall not suffer indignity. 1430

     * Caliban. I thank my noble lord. Wilt thou be pleased to
       hearken once again to the suit I made to thee?

     * Stephano. Marry, will I. kneel and repeat it; I will stand,
       and so shall Trinculo.

   [Enter ARIEL, invisible]
     * Caliban. As I told thee before, I am subject to a tyrant, a
       sorcerer, that by his cunning hath cheated me of the island.

     * Ariel. Thou liest.

     * Caliban. Thou liest, thou jesting monkey, thou: I would my
       valiant master would destroy thee! I do not lie. 1440

     * Stephano. Trinculo, if you trouble him any more in's tale, by
       this hand, I will supplant some of your teeth.

     * Trinculo. Why, I said nothing.

     * Stephano. Mum, then, and no more. Proceed.

     * Caliban. I say, by sorcery he got this isle; 1445
       From me he got it. if thy greatness will
       Revenge it on him,—for I know thou darest,
       But this thing dare not,—

     * Stephano. That's most certain.

     * Caliban. Thou shalt be lord of it and I'll serve thee. 1450

     * Stephano. How now shall this be compassed?
       Canst thou bring me to the party?

     * Caliban. Yea, yea, my lord: I'll yield him thee asleep,
       Where thou mayst knock a nail into his bead.

     * Ariel. Thou liest; thou canst not. 1455

     * Caliban. What a pied ninny's this! Thou scurvy patch!
       I do beseech thy greatness, give him blows
       And take his bottle from him: when that's gone
       He shall drink nought but brine; for I'll not show him
       Where the quick freshes are. 1460

     * Stephano. Trinculo, run into no further danger:
       interrupt the monster one word further, and,
       by this hand, I'll turn my mercy out o' doors
       and make a stock-fish of thee.

     * Trinculo. Why, what did I? I did nothing. I'll go farther 1465
       off.

     * Stephano. Didst thou not say he lied?

     * Ariel. Thou liest.

     * Stephano. Do I so? take thou that.
       [Beats TRINCULO] 1470
       As you like this, give me the lie another time.

     * Trinculo. I did not give the lie. Out o' your
       wits and bearing too? A pox o' your bottle!
       this can sack and drinking do. A murrain on
       your monster, and the devil take your fingers! 1475

     * Caliban. Ha, ha, ha!

     * Stephano. Now, forward with your tale. Prithee, stand farther
       off.

     * Caliban. Beat him enough: after a little time
       I'll beat him too. 1480

     * Stephano. Stand farther. Come, proceed.

     * Caliban. Why, as I told thee, 'tis a custom with him,
       I' th' afternoon to sleep: there thou mayst brain him,
       Having first seized his books, or with a log
       Batter his skull, or paunch him with a stake, 1485
       Or cut his wezand with thy knife. Remember
       First to possess his books; for without them
       He's but a sot, as I am, nor hath not
       One spirit to command: they all do hate him
       As rootedly as I. Burn but his books. 1490
       He has brave utensils,—for so he calls them—
       Which when he has a house, he'll deck withal
       And that most deeply to consider is
       The beauty of his daughter; he himself
       Calls her a nonpareil: I never saw a woman, 1495
       But only Sycorax my dam and she;
       But she as far surpasseth Sycorax
       As great'st does least.

     * Stephano. Is it so brave a lass?

     * Caliban. Ay, lord; she will become thy bed, I warrant. 1500
       And bring thee forth brave brood.

     * Stephano. Monster, I will kill this man: his daughter and I
       will be king and queen—save our graces!—and
       Trinculo and thyself shall be viceroys. Dost thou
       like the plot, Trinculo? 1505

     * Trinculo. Excellent.

     * Stephano. Give me thy hand: I am sorry I beat thee; but,
       while thou livest, keep a good tongue in thy head.

     * Caliban. Within this half hour will he be asleep:
       Wilt thou destroy him then? 1510

     * Stephano. Ay, on mine honour.

     * Ariel. This will I tell my master.

     * Caliban. Thou makest me merry; I am full of pleasure:
       Let us be jocund: will you troll the catch
       You taught me but while-ere? 1515

     * Stephano. At thy request, monster, I will do reason, any
       reason. Come on, Trinculo, let us sing.
       [Sings]
       Flout 'em and scout 'em
       And scout 'em and flout 'em 1520
       Thought is free.

     * Caliban. That's not the tune.

   [Ariel plays the tune on a tabour and pipe]
     * Stephano. What is this same?

     * Trinculo. This is the tune of our catch, played by the picture 1525
       of Nobody.

     * Stephano. If thou beest a man, show thyself in thy likeness:
       if thou beest a devil, take't as thou list.

     * Trinculo. O, forgive me my sins!

     * Stephano. He that dies pays all debts: I defy thee. Mercy upon us!
       1530

     * Caliban. Art thou afeard?

     * Stephano. No, monster, not I.

     * Caliban. Be not afeard; the isle is full of noises,
       Sounds and sweet airs, that give delight and hurt not.
       Sometimes a thousand twangling instruments 1535
       Will hum about mine ears, and sometime voices
       That, if I then had waked after long sleep,
       Will make me sleep again: and then, in dreaming,
       The clouds methought would open and show riches
       Ready to drop upon me that, when I waked, 1540
       I cried to dream again.

     * Stephano. This will prove a brave kingdom to me, where I shall
       have my music for nothing.

     * Caliban. When Prospero is destroyed.

     * Stephano. That shall be by and by: I remember the story. 1545

     * Trinculo. The sound is going away; let's follow it, and
       after do our work.

     * Stephano. Lead, monster; we'll follow. I would I could see
       this tabourer; he lays it on.

     * Trinculo. Wilt come? I'll follow, Stephano. 1550

   [Exeunt]

   Act III, Scene 3

   Another part of the island.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   [Enter ALONSO, SEBASTIAN, ANTONIO, GONZALO,] [p]ADRIAN, FRANCISCO, and
   others]
     * Gonzalo. By'r lakin, I can go no further, sir;
       My old bones ache: here's a maze trod indeed 1555
       Through forth-rights and meanders! By your patience,
       I needs must rest me.

     * Alonso. Old lord, I cannot blame thee,
       Who am myself attach'd with weariness,
       To the dulling of my spirits: sit down, and rest. 1560
       Even here I will put off my hope and keep it
       No longer for my flatterer: he is drown'd
       Whom thus we stray to find, and the sea mocks
       Our frustrate search on land. Well, let him go.

     * Antonio. [Aside to SEBASTIAN] I am right glad that he's so 1565
       out of hope.
       Do not, for one repulse, forego the purpose
       That you resolved to effect.

     * Sebastian. [Aside to ANTONIO] The next advantage
       Will we take throughly. 1570

     * Antonio. [Aside to SEBASTIAN] Let it be to-night;
       For, now they are oppress'd with travel, they
       Will not, nor cannot, use such vigilance
       As when they are fresh.

     * Sebastian. [Aside to ANTONIO] I say, to-night: no more. 1575

   [Solemn and strange music]
     * Alonso. What harmony is this? My good friends, hark!

     * Gonzalo. Marvellous sweet music!
       [Enter PROSPERO above, invisible. Enter several]
       strange Shapes, bringing in a banquet; 1580
       they dance about it with gentle actions of
       salutation; and, inviting the King, &c. to
       eat, they depart]

     * Alonso. Give us kind keepers, heavens! What were these?

     * Sebastian. A living drollery. Now I will believe 1585
       That there are unicorns, that in Arabia
       There is one tree, the phoenix' throne, one phoenix
       At this hour reigning there.

     * Antonio. I'll believe both;
       And what does else want credit, come to me, 1590
       And I'll be sworn 'tis true: travellers ne'er did
       lie,
       Though fools at home condemn 'em.

     * Gonzalo. If in Naples
       I should report this now, would they believe me? 1595
       If I should say, I saw such islanders—
       For, certes, these are people of the island—
       Who, though they are of monstrous shape, yet, note,
       Their manners are more gentle-kind than of
       Our human generation you shall find 1600
       Many, nay, almost any.

     * Prospero. [Aside] Honest lord,
       Thou hast said well; for some of you there present
       Are worse than devils.

     * Alonso. I cannot too much muse 1605
       Such shapes, such gesture and such sound, expressing,
       Although they want the use of tongue, a kind
       Of excellent dumb discourse.

     * Prospero. [Aside]. Praise in departing.

     * Francisco. They vanish'd strangely. 1610

     * Sebastian. No matter, since
       They have left their viands behind; for we have stomachs.
       Will't please you taste of what is here?

     * Alonso. Not I.

     * Gonzalo. Faith, sir, you need not fear. When we were boys, 1615
       Who would believe that there were mountaineers
       Dew-lapp'd like bulls, whose throats had hanging at 'em
       Wallets of flesh? or that there were such men
       Whose heads stood in their breasts? which now we find
       Each putter-out of five for one will bring us 1620
       Good warrant of.

     * Alonso. I will stand to and feed,
       Although my last: no matter, since I feel
       The best is past. Brother, my lord the duke,
       Stand to and do as we. 1625
       [Thunder and lightning. Enter ARIEL, like a]
       harpy; claps his wings upon the table; and,
       with a quaint device, the banquet vanishes]

     * Ariel. You are three men of sin, whom Destiny,
       That hath to instrument this lower world 1630
       And what is in't, the never-surfeited sea
       Hath caused to belch up you; and on this island
       Where man doth not inhabit; you 'mongst men
       Being most unfit to live. I have made you mad;
       And even with such-like valour men hang and drown 1635
       Their proper selves.
       [ALONSO, SEBASTIAN &c. draw their swords]
       You fools! I and my fellows
       Are ministers of Fate: the elements,
       Of whom your swords are temper'd, may as well 1640
       Wound the loud winds, or with bemock'd-at stabs
       Kill the still-closing waters, as diminish
       One dowle that's in my plume: my fellow-ministers
       Are like invulnerable. If you could hurt,
       Your swords are now too massy for your strengths 1645
       And will not be uplifted. But remember—
       For that's my business to you—that you three
       From Milan did supplant good Prospero;
       Exposed unto the sea, which hath requit it,
       Him and his innocent child: for which foul deed 1650
       The powers, delaying, not forgetting, have
       Incensed the seas and shores, yea, all the creatures,
       Against your peace. Thee of thy son, Alonso,
       They have bereft; and do pronounce by me:
       Lingering perdition, worse than any death 1655
       Can be at once, shall step by step attend
       You and your ways; whose wraths to guard you from—
       Which here, in this most desolate isle, else falls
       Upon your heads—is nothing but heart-sorrow
       And a clear life ensuing. 1660
       [He vanishes in thunder; then, to soft music]
       enter the Shapes again, and dance, with
       mocks and mows, and carrying out the table]

     * Prospero. Bravely the figure of this harpy hast thou
       Perform'd, my Ariel; a grace it had, devouring: 1665
       Of my instruction hast thou nothing bated
       In what thou hadst to say: so, with good life
       And observation strange, my meaner ministers
       Their several kinds have done. My high charms work
       And these mine enemies are all knit up 1670
       In their distractions; they now are in my power;
       And in these fits I leave them, while I visit
       Young Ferdinand, whom they suppose is drown'd,
       And his and mine loved darling.

   [Exit above]
     * Gonzalo. I' the name of something holy, sir, why stand you
       In this strange stare?

     * Alonso. O, it is monstrous, monstrous:
       Methought the billows spoke and told me of it;
       The winds did sing it to me, and the thunder, 1680
       That deep and dreadful organ-pipe, pronounced
       The name of Prosper: it did bass my trespass.
       Therefore my son i' the ooze is bedded, and
       I'll seek him deeper than e'er plummet sounded
       And with him there lie mudded. 1685

   [Exit]
     * Sebastian. But one fiend at a time,
       I'll fight their legions o'er.

     * Antonio. I'll be thy second.

   [Exeunt SEBASTIAN, and ANTONIO]
     * Gonzalo. All three of them are desperate: their great guilt,
       Like poison given to work a great time after,
       Now 'gins to bite the spirits. I do beseech you
       That are of suppler joints, follow them swiftly
       And hinder them from what this ecstasy 1695
       May now provoke them to.

     * Adrian. Follow, I pray you.

   [Exeunt]

   Act IV, Scene 1

   Before PROSPERO’S cell.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   [Enter PROSPERO, FERDINAND, and MIRANDA]
     * Prospero. If I have too austerely punish'd you, 1700
       Your compensation makes amends, for I
       Have given you here a third of mine own life,
       Or that for which I live; who once again
       I tender to thy hand: all thy vexations
       Were but my trials of thy love and thou 1705
       Hast strangely stood the test here, afore Heaven,
       I ratify this my rich gift. O Ferdinand,
       Do not smile at me that I boast her off,
       For thou shalt find she will outstrip all praise
       And make it halt behind her. 1710

     * Ferdinand. I do believe it
       Against an oracle.

     * Prospero. Then, as my gift and thine own acquisition
       Worthily purchased take my daughter: but
       If thou dost break her virgin-knot before 1715
       All sanctimonious ceremonies may
       With full and holy rite be minister'd,
       No sweet aspersion shall the heavens let fall
       To make this contract grow: but barren hate,
       Sour-eyed disdain and discord shall bestrew 1720
       The union of your bed with weeds so loathly
       That you shall hate it both: therefore take heed,
       As Hymen's lamps shall light you.

     * Ferdinand. As I hope
       For quiet days, fair issue and long life, 1725
       With such love as 'tis now, the murkiest den,
       The most opportune place, the strong'st suggestion.
       Our worser genius can, shall never melt
       Mine honour into lust, to take away
       The edge of that day's celebration 1730
       When I shall think: or Phoebus' steeds are founder'd,
       Or Night kept chain'd below.

     * Prospero. Fairly spoke.
       Sit then and talk with her; she is thine own.
       What, Ariel! my industrious servant, Ariel! 1735

   [Enter ARIEL]
     * Ariel. What would my potent master? here I am.

     * Prospero. Thou and thy meaner fellows your last service
       Did worthily perform; and I must use you
       In such another trick. Go bring the rabble, 1740
       O'er whom I give thee power, here to this place:
       Incite them to quick motion; for I must
       Bestow upon the eyes of this young couple
       Some vanity of mine art: it is my promise,
       And they expect it from me. 1745

     * Ariel. Presently?

     * Prospero. Ay, with a twink.

     * Ariel. Before you can say 'come' and 'go,'
       And breathe twice and cry 'so, so,'
       Each one, tripping on his toe, 1750
       Will be here with mop and mow.
       Do you love me, master? no?

     * Prospero. Dearly my delicate Ariel. Do not approach
       Till thou dost hear me call.

     * Ariel. Well, I conceive. 1755

   [Exit]
     * Prospero. Look thou be true; do not give dalliance
       Too much the rein: the strongest oaths are straw
       To the fire i' the blood: be more abstemious,
       Or else, good night your vow! 1760

     * Ferdinand. I warrant you sir;
       The white cold virgin snow upon my heart
       Abates the ardour of my liver.

     * Prospero. Well.
       Now come, my Ariel! bring a corollary, 1765
       Rather than want a spirit: appear and pertly!
       No tongue! all eyes! be silent.

   [Soft music]

   [Enter IRIS]
     * Iris. Ceres, most bounteous lady, thy rich leas 1770
       Of wheat, rye, barley, vetches, oats and pease;
       Thy turfy mountains, where live nibbling sheep,
       And flat meads thatch'd with stover, them to keep;
       Thy banks with pioned and twilled brims,
       Which spongy April at thy hest betrims, 1775
       To make cold nymphs chaste crowns; and thy broom -groves,
       Whose shadow the dismissed bachelor loves,
       Being lass-lorn: thy pole-clipt vineyard;
       And thy sea-marge, sterile and rocky-hard,
       Where thou thyself dost air;—the queen o' the sky, 1780
       Whose watery arch and messenger am I,
       Bids thee leave these, and with her sovereign grace,
       Here on this grass-plot, in this very place,
       To come and sport: her peacocks fly amain:
       Approach, rich Ceres, her to entertain. 1785

   [Enter CERES]
     * Ceres. Hail, many-colour'd messenger, that ne'er
       Dost disobey the wife of Jupiter;
       Who with thy saffron wings upon my flowers
       Diffusest honey-drops, refreshing showers, 1790
       And with each end of thy blue bow dost crown
       My bosky acres and my unshrubb'd down,
       Rich scarf to my proud earth; why hath thy queen
       Summon'd me hither, to this short-grass'd green?

     * Iris. A contract of true love to celebrate; 1795
       And some donation freely to estate
       On the blest lovers.

     * Ceres. Tell me, heavenly bow,
       If Venus or her son, as thou dost know,
       Do now attend the queen? Since they did plot 1800
       The means that dusky Dis my daughter got,
       Her and her blind boy's scandal'd company
       I have forsworn.

     * Iris. Of her society
       Be not afraid: I met her deity 1805
       Cutting the clouds towards Paphos and her son
       Dove-drawn with her. Here thought they to have done
       Some wanton charm upon this man and maid,
       Whose vows are, that no bed-right shall be paid
       Till Hymen's torch be lighted: but vain; 1810
       Mars's hot minion is returned again;
       Her waspish-headed son has broke his arrows,
       Swears he will shoot no more but play with sparrows
       And be a boy right out.

     * Ceres. High'st queen of state, 1815
       Great Juno, comes; I know her by her gait.

   [Enter JUNO]
     * Juno. How does my bounteous sister? Go with me
       To bless this twain, that they may prosperous be
       And honour'd in their issue. 1820

   [They sing:]
     * Juno. Honour, riches, marriage-blessing,
       Long continuance, and increasing,
       Hourly joys be still upon you!
       Juno sings her blessings upon you. 1825

     * Ceres. Earth's increase, foison plenty,
       Barns and garners never empty,
       Vines and clustering bunches growing,
       Plants with goodly burthen bowing;
       Spring come to you at the farthest 1830
       In the very end of harvest!
       Scarcity and want shall shun you;
       Ceres' blessing so is on you.

     * Ferdinand. This is a most majestic vision, and
       Harmoniously charmingly. May I be bold 1835
       To think these spirits?

     * Prospero. Spirits, which by mine art
       I have from their confines call'd to enact
       My present fancies.

     * Ferdinand. Let me live here ever; 1840
       So rare a wonder'd father and a wife
       Makes this place Paradise.
       [Juno and Ceres whisper, and send Iris on]
       employment]

     * Prospero. Sweet, now, silence! 1845
       Juno and Ceres whisper seriously;
       There's something else to do: hush, and be mute,
       Or else our spell is marr'd.

     * Iris. You nymphs, call'd Naiads, of the windring brooks,
       With your sedged crowns and ever-harmless looks, 1850
       Leave your crisp channels and on this green land
       Answer your summons; Juno does command:
       Come, temperate nymphs, and help to celebrate
       A contract of true love; be not too late.
       [Enter certain Nymphs] 1855
       You sunburnt sicklemen, of August weary,
       Come hither from the furrow and be merry:
       Make holiday; your rye-straw hats put on
       And these fresh nymphs encounter every one
       In country footing. 1860
       [Enter certain Reapers, properly habited: they]
       join with the Nymphs in a graceful dance;
       towards the end whereof PROSPERO starts
       suddenly, and speaks; after which, to a
       strange, hollow, and confused noise, they 1865
       heavily vanish]

     * Prospero. [Aside] I had forgot that foul conspiracy
       Of the beast Caliban and his confederates
       Against my life: the minute of their plot
       Is almost come. 1870
       [To the Spirits]
       Well done! avoid; no more!

     * Ferdinand. This is strange: your father's in some passion
       That works him strongly.

     * Miranda. Never till this day 1875
       Saw I him touch'd with anger so distemper'd.

     * Prospero. You do look, my son, in a moved sort,
       As if you were dismay'd: be cheerful, sir.
       Our revels now are ended. These our actors,
       As I foretold you, were all spirits and 1880
       Are melted into air, into thin air:
       And, like the baseless fabric of this vision,
       The cloud-capp'd towers, the gorgeous palaces,
       The solemn temples, the great globe itself,
       Ye all which it inherit, shall dissolve 1885
       And, like this insubstantial pageant faded,
       Leave not a rack behind. We are such stuff
       As dreams are made on, and our little life
       Is rounded with a sleep. Sir, I am vex'd;
       Bear with my weakness; my, brain is troubled: 1890
       Be not disturb'd with my infirmity:
       If you be pleased, retire into my cell
       And there repose: a turn or two I'll walk,
       To still my beating mind.

     * Ferdinand. [with Miranda] We wish your peace. 1895

   [Exeunt]
     * Prospero. Come with a thought I thank thee, Ariel: come.

   [Enter ARIEL]
     * Ariel. Thy thoughts I cleave to. What's thy pleasure?

     * Prospero. Spirit, 1900
       We must prepare to meet with Caliban.

     * Ariel. Ay, my commander: when I presented Ceres,
       I thought to have told thee of it, but I fear'd
       Lest I might anger thee.

     * Prospero. Say again, where didst thou leave these varlets? 1905

     * Ariel. I told you, sir, they were red-hot with drinking;
       So fun of valour that they smote the air
       For breathing in their faces; beat the ground
       For kissing of their feet; yet always bending
       Towards their project. Then I beat my tabour; 1910
       At which, like unback'd colts, they prick'd
       their ears,
       Advanced their eyelids, lifted up their noses
       As they smelt music: so I charm'd their ears
       That calf-like they my lowing follow'd through 1915
       Tooth'd briers, sharp furzes, pricking goss and thorns,
       Which entered their frail shins: at last I left them
       I' the filthy-mantled pool beyond your cell,
       There dancing up to the chins, that the foul lake
       O'erstunk their feet. 1920

     * Prospero. This was well done, my bird.
       Thy shape invisible retain thou still:
       The trumpery in my house, go bring it hither,
       For stale to catch these thieves.

     * Ariel. I go, I go. 1925

   [Exit]
     * Prospero. A devil, a born devil, on whose nature
       Nurture can never stick; on whom my pains,
       Humanely taken, all, all lost, quite lost;
       And as with age his body uglier grows, 1930
       So his mind cankers. I will plague them all,
       Even to roaring.
       [Re-enter ARIEL, loaden with glistering apparel, &c]
       Come, hang them on this line.
       [PROSPERO and ARIEL remain invisible. Enter] 1935
       CALIBAN, STEPHANO, and TRINCULO, all wet]

     * Caliban. Pray you, tread softly, that the blind mole may not
       Hear a foot fall: we now are near his cell.

     * Stephano. Monster, your fairy, which you say is
       a harmless fairy, has done little better than 1940
       played the Jack with us.

     * Trinculo. Monster, I do smell all horse-piss; at
       which my nose is in great indignation.

     * Stephano. So is mine. Do you hear, monster? If I should take
       a displeasure against you, look you,— 1945

     * Trinculo. Thou wert but a lost monster.

     * Caliban. Good my lord, give me thy favour still.
       Be patient, for the prize I'll bring thee to
       Shall hoodwink this mischance: therefore speak softly.
       All's hush'd as midnight yet. 1950

     * Trinculo. Ay, but to lose our bottles in the pool,—

     * Stephano. There is not only disgrace and dishonour in that,
       monster, but an infinite loss.

     * Trinculo. That's more to me than my wetting: yet this is your
       harmless fairy, monster. 1955

     * Stephano. I will fetch off my bottle, though I be o'er ears
       for my labour.

     * Caliban. Prithee, my king, be quiet. Seest thou here,
       This is the mouth o' the cell: no noise, and enter.
       Do that good mischief which may make this island 1960
       Thine own for ever, and I, thy Caliban,
       For aye thy foot-licker.

     * Stephano. Give me thy hand. I do begin to have bloody thoughts.

     * Trinculo. O king Stephano! O peer! O worthy Stephano! look
       what a wardrobe here is for thee! 1965

     * Caliban. Let it alone, thou fool; it is but trash.

     * Trinculo. O, ho, monster! we know what belongs to a frippery.
       O king Stephano!

     * Stephano. Put off that gown, Trinculo; by this hand, I'll have
       that gown. 1970

     * Trinculo. Thy grace shall have it.

     * Caliban. The dropsy drown this fool I what do you mean
       To dote thus on such luggage? Let's alone
       And do the murder first: if he awake,
       From toe to crown he'll fill our skins with pinches, 1975
       Make us strange stuff.

     * Stephano. Be you quiet, monster. Mistress line,
       is not this my jerkin? Now is the jerkin under
       the line: now, jerkin, you are like to lose your
       hair and prove a bald jerkin. 1980

     * Trinculo. Do, do: we steal by line and level, an't like your grace.

     * Stephano. I thank thee for that jest; here's a garment for't:
       wit shall not go unrewarded while I am king of this
       country. 'Steal by line and level' is an excellent
       pass of pate; there's another garment for't. 1985

     * Trinculo. Monster, come, put some lime upon your fingers, and
       away with the rest.

     * Caliban. I will have none on't: we shall lose our time,
       And all be turn'd to barnacles, or to apes
       With foreheads villanous low. 1990

     * Stephano. Monster, lay-to your fingers: help to bear this
       away where my hogshead of wine is, or I'll turn you
       out of my kingdom: go to, carry this.

     * Trinculo. And this.

     * Stephano. Ay, and this. 1995
       [A noise of hunters heard. Enter divers Spirits,]
       in shape of dogs and hounds, and hunt them about,
       PROSPERO and ARIEL setting them on]

     * Prospero. Hey, Mountain, hey!

     * Ariel. Silver I there it goes, Silver! 2000

     * Prospero. Fury, Fury! there, Tyrant, there! hark! hark!
       [CALIBAN, STEPHANO, and TRINCULO, are]
       driven out]
       Go charge my goblins that they grind their joints
       With dry convulsions, shorten up their sinews 2005
       With aged cramps, and more pinch-spotted make them
       Than pard or cat o' mountain.

     * Ariel. Hark, they roar!

     * Prospero. Let them be hunted soundly. At this hour
       Lie at my mercy all mine enemies: 2010
       Shortly shall all my labours end, and thou
       Shalt have the air at freedom: for a little
       Follow, and do me service.

   [Exeunt]
   _______________________________________________________________________



   Act V, Scene 1

   Before PROSPERO’S cell.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   [Enter PROSPERO in his magic robes, and ARIEL]
     * Prospero. Now does my project gather to a head:
       My charms crack not; my spirits obey; and time
       Goes upright with his carriage. How's the day?

     * Ariel. On the sixth hour; at which time, my lord,
       You said our work should cease. 2020

     * Prospero. I did say so,
       When first I raised the tempest. Say, my spirit,
       How fares the king and's followers?

     * Ariel. Confined together
       In the same fashion as you gave in charge, 2025
       Just as you left them; all prisoners, sir,
       In the line-grove which weather-fends your cell;
       They cannot budge till your release. The king,
       His brother and yours, abide all three distracted
       And the remainder mourning over them, 2030
       Brimful of sorrow and dismay; but chiefly
       Him that you term'd, sir, 'The good old lord Gonzalo;'
       His tears run down his beard, like winter's drops
       From eaves of reeds. Your charm so strongly works 'em
       That if you now beheld them, your affections 2035
       Would become tender.

     * Prospero. Dost thou think so, spirit?

     * Ariel. Mine would, sir, were I human.

     * Prospero. And mine shall.
       Hast thou, which art but air, a touch, a feeling 2040
       Of their afflictions, and shall not myself,
       One of their kind, that relish all as sharply,
       Passion as they, be kindlier moved than thou art?
       Though with their high wrongs I am struck to the quick,
       Yet with my nobler reason 'gaitist my fury 2045
       Do I take part: the rarer action is
       In virtue than in vengeance: they being penitent,
       The sole drift of my purpose doth extend
       Not a frown further. Go release them, Ariel:
       My charms I'll break, their senses I'll restore, 2050
       And they shall be themselves.

     * Ariel. I'll fetch them, sir.

   [Exit]
     * Prospero. Ye elves of hills, brooks, standing lakes and groves,
       And ye that on the sands with printless foot 2055
       Do chase the ebbing Neptune and do fly him
       When he comes back; you demi-puppets that
       By moonshine do the green sour ringlets make,
       Whereof the ewe not bites, and you whose pastime
       Is to make midnight mushrooms, that rejoice 2060
       To hear the solemn curfew; by whose aid,
       Weak masters though ye be, I have bedimm'd
       The noontide sun, call'd forth the mutinous winds,
       And 'twixt the green sea and the azured vault
       Set roaring war: to the dread rattling thunder 2065
       Have I given fire and rifted Jove's stout oak
       With his own bolt; the strong-based promontory
       Have I made shake and by the spurs pluck'd up
       The pine and cedar: graves at my command
       Have waked their sleepers, oped, and let 'em forth 2070
       By my so potent art. But this rough magic
       I here abjure, and, when I have required
       Some heavenly music, which even now I do,
       To work mine end upon their senses that
       This airy charm is for, I'll break my staff, 2075
       Bury it certain fathoms in the earth,
       And deeper than did ever plummet sound
       I'll drown my book.
       [Solemn music]
       [Re-enter ARIEL before: then ALONSO, with a] 2080
       frantic gesture, attended by GONZALO;
       SEBASTIAN and ANTONIO in like manner,
       attended by ADRIAN and FRANCISCO they all
       enter the circle which PROSPERO had made,
       and there stand charmed; which PROSPERO 2085
       observing, speaks:]
       A solemn air and the best comforter
       To an unsettled fancy cure thy brains,
       Now useless, boil'd within thy skull! There stand,
       For you are spell-stopp'd. 2090
       Holy Gonzalo, honourable man,
       Mine eyes, even sociable to the show of thine,
       Fall fellowly drops. The charm dissolves apace,
       And as the morning steals upon the night,
       Melting the darkness, so their rising senses 2095
       Begin to chase the ignorant fumes that mantle
       Their clearer reason. O good Gonzalo,
       My true preserver, and a loyal sir
       To him you follow'st! I will pay thy graces
       Home both in word and deed. Most cruelly 2100
       Didst thou, Alonso, use me and my daughter:
       Thy brother was a furtherer in the act.
       Thou art pinch'd fort now, Sebastian. Flesh and blood,
       You, brother mine, that entertain'd ambition,
       Expell'd remorse and nature; who, with Sebastian, 2105
       Whose inward pinches therefore are most strong,
       Would here have kill'd your king; I do forgive thee,
       Unnatural though thou art. Their understanding
       Begins to swell, and the approaching tide
       Will shortly fill the reasonable shore 2110
       That now lies foul and muddy. Not one of them
       That yet looks on me, or would know me Ariel,
       Fetch me the hat and rapier in my cell:
       I will discase me, and myself present
       As I was sometime Milan: quickly, spirit; 2115
       Thou shalt ere long be free.
       [ARIEL sings and helps to attire him]
       Where the bee sucks. there suck I:
       In a cowslip's bell I lie;
       There I couch when owls do cry. 2120
       On the bat's back I do fly
       After summer merrily.
       Merrily, merrily shall I live now
       Under the blossom that hangs on the bough.

     * Prospero. Why, that's my dainty Ariel! I shall miss thee: 2125
       But yet thou shalt have freedom: so, so, so.
       To the king's ship, invisible as thou art:
       There shalt thou find the mariners asleep
       Under the hatches; the master and the boatswain
       Being awake, enforce them to this place, 2130
       And presently, I prithee.

     * Ariel. I drink the air before me, and return
       Or ere your pulse twice beat.

   [Exit]
     * Gonzalo. All torment, trouble, wonder and amazement 2135
       Inhabits here: some heavenly power guide us
       Out of this fearful country!

     * Prospero. Behold, sir king,
       The wronged Duke of Milan, Prospero:
       For more assurance that a living prince 2140
       Does now speak to thee, I embrace thy body;
       And to thee and thy company I bid
       A hearty welcome.

     * Alonso. Whether thou best he or no,
       Or some enchanted trifle to abuse me, 2145
       As late I have been, I not know: thy pulse
       Beats as of flesh and blood; and, since I saw thee,
       The affliction of my mind amends, with which,
       I fear, a madness held me: this must crave,
       An if this be at all, a most strange story. 2150
       Thy dukedom I resign and do entreat
       Thou pardon me my wrongs. But how should Prospero
       Be living and be here?

     * Prospero. First, noble friend,
       Let me embrace thine age, whose honour cannot 2155
       Be measured or confined.

     * Gonzalo. Whether this be
       Or be not, I'll not swear.

     * Prospero. You do yet taste
       Some subtilties o' the isle, that will not let you 2160
       Believe things certain. Welcome, my friends all!
       [Aside to SEBASTIAN and ANTONIO]
       But you, my brace of lords, were I so minded,
       I here could pluck his highness' frown upon you
       And justify you traitors: at this time 2165
       I will tell no tales.

     * Sebastian. [Aside] The devil speaks in him.

     * Prospero. No.
       For you, most wicked sir, whom to call brother
       Would even infect my mouth, I do forgive 2170
       Thy rankest fault; all of them; and require
       My dukedom of thee, which perforce, I know,
       Thou must restore.

     * Alonso. If thou be'st Prospero,
       Give us particulars of thy preservation; 2175
       How thou hast met us here, who three hours since
       Were wreck'd upon this shore; where I have lost—
       How sharp the point of this remembrance is!—
       My dear son Ferdinand.

     * Prospero. I am woe for't, sir. 2180

     * Alonso. Irreparable is the loss, and patience
       Says it is past her cure.

     * Prospero. I rather think
       You have not sought her help, of whose soft grace
       For the like loss I have her sovereign aid 2185
       And rest myself content.

     * Alonso. You the like loss!

     * Prospero. As great to me as late; and, supportable
       To make the dear loss, have I means much weaker
       Than you may call to comfort you, for I 2190
       Have lost my daughter.

     * Alonso. A daughter?
       O heavens, that they were living both in Naples,
       The king and queen there! that they were, I wish
       Myself were mudded in that oozy bed 2195
       Where my son lies. When did you lose your daughter?

     * Prospero. In this last tempest. I perceive these lords
       At this encounter do so much admire
       That they devour their reason and scarce think
       Their eyes do offices of truth, their words 2200
       Are natural breath: but, howsoe'er you have
       Been justled from your senses, know for certain
       That I am Prospero and that very duke
       Which was thrust forth of Milan, who most strangely
       Upon this shore, where you were wreck'd, was landed, 2205
       To be the lord on't. No more yet of this;
       For 'tis a chronicle of day by day,
       Not a relation for a breakfast nor
       Befitting this first meeting. Welcome, sir;
       This cell's my court: here have I few attendants 2210
       And subjects none abroad: pray you, look in.
       My dukedom since you have given me again,
       I will requite you with as good a thing;
       At least bring forth a wonder, to content ye
       As much as me my dukedom. 2215
       [Here PROSPERO discovers FERDINAND and MIRANDA]
       playing at chess]

     * Miranda. Sweet lord, you play me false.

     * Ferdinand. No, my dear'st love,
       I would not for the world. 2220

     * Miranda. Yes, for a score of kingdoms you should wrangle,
       And I would call it, fair play.

     * Alonso. If this prove
       A vision of the Island, one dear son
       Shall I twice lose. 2225

     * Sebastian. A most high miracle!

     * Ferdinand. Though the seas threaten, they are merciful;
       I have cursed them without cause.

   [Kneels]
     * Alonso. Now all the blessings 2230
       Of a glad father compass thee about!
       Arise, and say how thou camest here.

     * Miranda. O, wonder!
       How many goodly creatures are there here!
       How beauteous mankind is! O brave new world, 2235
       That has such people in't!

     * Prospero. 'Tis new to thee.

     * Alonso. What is this maid with whom thou wast at play?
       Your eld'st acquaintance cannot be three hours:
       Is she the goddess that hath sever'd us, 2240
       And brought us thus together?

     * Ferdinand. Sir, she is mortal;
       But by immortal Providence she's mine:
       I chose her when I could not ask my father
       For his advice, nor thought I had one. She 2245
       Is daughter to this famous Duke of Milan,
       Of whom so often I have heard renown,
       But never saw before; of whom I have
       Received a second life; and second father
       This lady makes him to me. 2250

     * Alonso. I am hers:
       But, O, how oddly will it sound that I
       Must ask my child forgiveness!

     * Prospero. There, sir, stop:
       Let us not burthen our remembrance with 2255
       A heaviness that's gone.

     * Gonzalo. I have inly wept,
       Or should have spoke ere this. Look down, you god,
       And on this couple drop a blessed crown!
       For it is you that have chalk'd forth the way 2260
       Which brought us hither.

     * Alonso. I say, Amen, Gonzalo!

     * Gonzalo. Was Milan thrust from Milan, that his issue
       Should become kings of Naples? O, rejoice
       Beyond a common joy, and set it down 2265
       With gold on lasting pillars: In one voyage
       Did Claribel her husband find at Tunis,
       And Ferdinand, her brother, found a wife
       Where he himself was lost, Prospero his dukedom
       In a poor isle and all of us ourselves 2270
       When no man was his own.

     * Alonso. [To FERDINAND and MIRANDA] Give me your hands:
       Let grief and sorrow still embrace his heart
       That doth not wish you joy!

     * Gonzalo. Be it so! Amen! 2275
       [Re-enter ARIEL, with the Master and Boatswain]
       amazedly following]
       O, look, sir, look, sir! here is more of us:
       I prophesied, if a gallows were on land,
       This fellow could not drown. Now, blasphemy, 2280
       That swear'st grace o'erboard, not an oath on shore?
       Hast thou no mouth by land? What is the news?

     * Boatswain. The best news is, that we have safely found
       Our king and company; the next, our ship—
       Which, but three glasses since, we gave out split— 2285
       Is tight and yare and bravely rigg'd as when
       We first put out to sea.

     * Ariel. [Aside to PROSPERO] Sir, all this service
       Have I done since I went.

     * Prospero. [Aside to ARIEL] My tricksy spirit! 2290

     * Alonso. These are not natural events; they strengthen
       From strange to stranger. Say, how came you hither?

     * Boatswain. If I did think, sir, I were well awake,
       I'ld strive to tell you. We were dead of sleep,
       And—how we know not—all clapp'd under hatches; 2295
       Where but even now with strange and several noises
       Of roaring, shrieking, howling, jingling chains,
       And more diversity of sounds, all horrible,
       We were awaked; straightway, at liberty;
       Where we, in all her trim, freshly beheld 2300
       Our royal, good and gallant ship, our master
       Capering to eye her: on a trice, so please you,
       Even in a dream, were we divided from them
       And were brought moping hither.

     * Ariel. [Aside to PROSPERO] Was't well done? 2305

     * Prospero. [Aside to ARIEL] Bravely, my diligence. Thou shalt be
       free.

     * Alonso. This is as strange a maze as e'er men trod
       And there is in this business more than nature
       Was ever conduct of: some oracle
       Must rectify our knowledge. 2310

     * Prospero. Sir, my liege,
       Do not infest your mind with beating on
       The strangeness of this business; at pick'd leisure
       Which shall be shortly, single I'll resolve you,
       Which to you shall seem probable, of every 2315
       These happen'd accidents; till when, be cheerful
       And think of each thing well.
       [Aside to ARIEL]
       Come hither, spirit:
       Set Caliban and his companions free; 2320
       Untie the spell.
       [Exit ARIEL]
       How fares my gracious sir?
       There are yet missing of your company
       Some few odd lads that you remember not. 2325
       [Re-enter ARIEL, driving in CALIBAN, STEPHANO]
       and TRINCULO, in their stolen apparel]

     * Stephano. Every man shift for all the rest, and
       let no man take care for himself; for all is
       but fortune. Coragio, bully-monster, coragio! 2330

     * Trinculo. If these be true spies which I wear in my head,
       here's a goodly sight.

     * Caliban. O Setebos, these be brave spirits indeed!
       How fine my master is! I am afraid
       He will chastise me. 2335

     * Sebastian. Ha, ha!
       What things are these, my lord Antonio?
       Will money buy 'em?

     * Antonio. Very like; one of them
       Is a plain fish, and, no doubt, marketable. 2340

     * Prospero. Mark but the badges of these men, my lords,
       Then say if they be true. This mis-shapen knave,
       His mother was a witch, and one so strong
       That could control the moon, make flows and ebbs,
       And deal in her command without her power. 2345
       These three have robb'd me; and this demi-devil—
       For he's a bastard one—had plotted with them
       To take my life. Two of these fellows you
       Must know and own; this thing of darkness!
       Acknowledge mine. 2350

     * Caliban. I shall be pinch'd to death.

     * Alonso. Is not this Stephano, my drunken butler?

     * Sebastian. He is drunk now: where had he wine?

     * Alonso. And Trinculo is reeling ripe: where should they
       Find this grand liquor that hath gilded 'em? 2355
       How camest thou in this pickle?

     * Trinculo. I have been in such a pickle since I
       saw you last that, I fear me, will never out of
       my bones: I shall not fear fly-blowing.

     * Sebastian. Why, how now, Stephano! 2360

     * Stephano. O, touch me not; I am not Stephano, but a cramp.

     * Prospero. You'ld be king o' the isle, sirrah?

     * Stephano. I should have been a sore one then.

     * Alonso. This is a strange thing as e'er I look'd on.

   [Pointing to Caliban]
     * Prospero. He is as disproportion'd in his manners
       As in his shape. Go, sirrah, to my cell;
       Take with you your companions; as you look
       To have my pardon, trim it handsomely.

     * Caliban. Ay, that I will; and I'll be wise hereafter 2370
       And seek for grace. What a thrice-double ass
       Was I, to take this drunkard for a god
       And worship this dull fool!

     * Prospero. Go to; away!

     * Alonso. Hence, and bestow your luggage where you found it. 2375

     * Sebastian. Or stole it, rather.

   [Exeunt CALIBAN, STEPHANO, and TRINCULO]
     * Prospero. Sir, I invite your highness and your train
       To my poor cell, where you shall take your rest
       For this one night; which, part of it, I'll waste 2380
       With such discourse as, I not doubt, shall make it
       Go quick away; the story of my life
       And the particular accidents gone by
       Since I came to this isle: and in the morn
       I'll bring you to your ship and so to Naples, 2385
       Where I have hope to see the nuptial
       Of these our dear-beloved solemnized;
       And thence retire me to my Milan, where
       Every third thought shall be my grave.

     * Alonso. I long 2390
       To hear the story of your life, which must
       Take the ear strangely.

     * Prospero. I'll deliver all;
       And promise you calm seas, auspicious gales
       And sail so expeditious that shall catch 2395
       Your royal fleet far off.
       [Aside to ARIEL]
       My Ariel, chick,
       That is thy charge: then to the elements
       Be free, and fare thou well! Please you, draw near. 2400
       [Exeunt]
       EPILOGUE

   [Spoken by PROSPERO]
     * Prospero. Now my charms are all o'erthrown,
       And what strength I have's mine own, 2405
       Which is most faint: now, 'tis true,
       I must be here confined by you,
       Or sent to Naples. Let me not,
       Since I have my dukedom got
       And pardon'd the deceiver, dwell 2410
       In this bare island by your spell;
       But release me from my bands
       With the help of your good hands:
       Gentle breath of yours my sails
       Must fill, or else my project fails, 2415
       Which was to please. Now I want
       Spirits to enforce, art to enchant,
       And my ending is despair,
       Unless I be relieved by prayer,
       Which pierces so that it assaults 2420
       Mercy itself and frees all faults.
       As you from crimes would pardon'd be,
       Let your indulgence set me free.
