                                 SONNET CIV

                  To me, fair friend, you never can be old,
                 For as you were when first your eye I eyed,
              Such seems your beauty still. Three winters cold
              Have from the forests shook three summers' pride,
              Three beauteous springs to yellow autumn turn'd 5
                   In process of the seasons have I seen,
               Three April perfumes in three hot Junes burn'd,
              Since first I saw you fresh, which yet are green.
                   Ah! yet doth beauty, like a dial-hand,
               Steal from his figure and no pace perceived; 10
             So your sweet hue, which methinks still doth stand,
                  Hath motion and mine eye may be deceived:
                 For fear of which, hear this, thou age unbred;
                 Ere you were born was beauty's summer dead. 14
