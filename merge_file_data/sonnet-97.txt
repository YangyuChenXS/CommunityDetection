                   How like a winter hath my absence been
                From thee, the pleasure of the fleeting year!
              What freezings have I felt, what dark days seen!
                  What old December's bareness every where!
               And yet this time removed was summer's time, 5
                 The teeming autumn, big with rich increase,
                   Bearing the wanton burden of the prime,
               Like widow'd wombs after their lords' decease:
                    Yet this abundant issue seem'd to me
                But hope of orphans and unfather'd fruit; 10
                 For summer and his pleasures wait on thee,
                  And, thou away, the very birds are mute;
                   Or, if they sing, 'tis with so dull a cheer
              That leaves look pale, dreading the winter's near. 14
