                                 SONNET XLIV

               If the dull substance of my flesh were thought,
                 Injurious distance should not stop my way;
                For then despite of space I would be brought,
                From limits far remote where thou dost stay.
                 No matter then although my foot did stand 5
                 Upon the farthest earth removed from thee;
                For nimble thought can jump both sea and land
                As soon as think the place where he would be.
               But ah! thought kills me that I am not thought,
            To leap large lengths of miles when thou art gone, 10
                 But that so much of earth and water wrought
                 I must attend time's leisure with my moan,
                      Receiving nought by elements so slow
                   But heavy tears, badges of either's woe. 14
