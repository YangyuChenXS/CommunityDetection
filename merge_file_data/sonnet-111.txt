                                 SONNET CXI

                  O, for my sake do you with Fortune chide,
                   The guilty goddess of my harmful deeds,
                   That did not better for my life provide
               Than public means which public manners breeds.
              Thence comes it that my name receives a brand, 5
                   And almost thence my nature is subdued
                 To what it works in, like the dyer's hand:
                    Pity me then and wish I were renew'd;
                Whilst, like a willing patient, I will drink
               Potions of eisel 'gainst my strong infection 10
                   No bitterness that I will bitter think,
                 Nor double penance, to correct correction.
                   Pity me then, dear friend, and I assure ye
                  Even that your pity is enough to cure me. 14

                                      O
