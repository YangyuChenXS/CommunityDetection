                                 SONNET XXII

                  My glass shall not persuade me I am old,
                 So long as youth and thou are of one date;
                  But when in thee time's furrows I behold,
                  Then look I death my days should expiate.
                 For all that beauty that doth cover thee 5
                   Is but the seemly raiment of my heart,
               Which in thy breast doth live, as thine in me:
                   How can I then be elder than thou art?
                  O, therefore, love, be of thyself so wary
                 As I, not for myself, but for thee will; 10
                Bearing thy heart, which I will keep so chary
                  As tender nurse her babe from faring ill.
                  Presume not on thy heart when mine is slain;
                Thou gavest me thine, not to give back again. 14

                                      O
