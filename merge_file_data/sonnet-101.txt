                   O truant Muse, what shall be thy amends
                  For thy neglect of truth in beauty dyed?
                  Both truth and beauty on my love depends;
                  So dost thou too, and therein dignified.
                Make answer, Muse: wilt thou not haply say 5
               'Truth needs no colour, with his colour fix'd;
                  Beauty no pencil, beauty's truth to lay;
                   But best is best, if never intermix'd?'
               Because he needs no praise, wilt thou be dumb?
                Excuse not silence so; for't lies in thee 10
                   To make him much outlive a gilded tomb,
                    And to be praised of ages yet to be.
                   Then do thy office, Muse; I teach thee how
                 To make him seem long hence as he shows now. 14

                                      O
