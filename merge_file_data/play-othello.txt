   Act I, Scene 1

   Venice. A street.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   [Enter RODERIGO and IAGO]
     * Roderigo. Tush! never tell me; I take it much unkindly
       That thou, Iago, who hast had my purse
       As if the strings were thine, shouldst know of this.

     * Iago. 'Sblood, but you will not hear me: 5
       If ever I did dream of such a matter, Abhor me.

     * Roderigo. Thou told'st me thou didst hold him in thy hate.

     * Iago. Despise me, if I do not. Three great ones of the city,
       In personal suit to make me his lieutenant,
       Off-capp'd to him: and, by the faith of man, 10
       I know my price, I am worth no worse a place:
       But he; as loving his own pride and purposes,
       Evades them, with a bombast circumstance
       Horribly stuff'd with epithets of war;
       And, in conclusion, 15
       Nonsuits my mediators; for, 'Certes,' says he,
       'I have already chose my officer.'
       And what was he?
       Forsooth, a great arithmetician,
       One Michael Cassio, a Florentine, 20
       A fellow almost damn'd in a fair wife;
       That never set a squadron in the field,
       Nor the division of a battle knows
       More than a spinster; unless the bookish theoric,
       Wherein the toged consuls can propose 25
       As masterly as he: mere prattle, without practise,
       Is all his soldiership. But he, sir, had the election:
       And I, of whom his eyes had seen the proof
       At Rhodes, at Cyprus and on other grounds
       Christian and heathen, must be be-lee'd and calm'd 30
       By debitor and creditor: this counter-caster,
       He, in good time, must his lieutenant be,
       And I—God bless the mark!—his Moorship's ancient.

     * Roderigo. By heaven, I rather would have been his hangman.

     * Iago. Why, there's no remedy; 'tis the curse of service, 35
       Preferment goes by letter and affection,
       And not by old gradation, where each second
       Stood heir to the first. Now, sir, be judge yourself,
       Whether I in any just term am affined
       To love the Moor. 40

     * Roderigo. I would not follow him then.

     * Iago. O, sir, content you;
       I follow him to serve my turn upon him:
       We cannot all be masters, nor all masters
       Cannot be truly follow'd. You shall mark 45
       Many a duteous and knee-crooking knave,
       That, doting on his own obsequious bondage,
       Wears out his time, much like his master's ass,
       For nought but provender, and when he's old, cashier'd:
       Whip me such honest knaves. Others there are 50
       Who, trimm'd in forms and visages of duty,
       Keep yet their hearts attending on themselves,
       And, throwing but shows of service on their lords,
       Do well thrive by them and when they have lined
       their coats 55
       Do themselves homage: these fellows have some soul;
       And such a one do I profess myself. For, sir,
       It is as sure as you are Roderigo,
       Were I the Moor, I would not be Iago:
       In following him, I follow but myself; 60
       Heaven is my judge, not I for love and duty,
       But seeming so, for my peculiar end:
       For when my outward action doth demonstrate
       The native act and figure of my heart
       In compliment extern, 'tis not long after 65
       But I will wear my heart upon my sleeve
       For daws to peck at: I am not what I am.

     * Roderigo. What a full fortune does the thicklips owe
       If he can carry't thus!

     * Iago. Call up her father, 70
       Rouse him: make after him, poison his delight,
       Proclaim him in the streets; incense her kinsmen,
       And, though he in a fertile climate dwell,
       Plague him with flies: though that his joy be joy,
       Yet throw such changes of vexation on't, 75
       As it may lose some colour.

     * Roderigo. Here is her father's house; I'll call aloud.

     * Iago. Do, with like timorous accent and dire yell
       As when, by night and negligence, the fire
       Is spied in populous cities. 80

     * Roderigo. What, ho, Brabantio! Signior Brabantio, ho!

     * Iago. Awake! what, ho, Brabantio! thieves! thieves! thieves!
       Look to your house, your daughter and your bags!
       Thieves! thieves!

   [BRABANTIO appears above, at a window]
     * Brabantio. What is the reason of this terrible summons?
       What is the matter there?

     * Roderigo. Signior, is all your family within?

     * Iago. Are your doors lock'd?

     * Brabantio. Why, wherefore ask you this? 90

     * Iago. 'Zounds, sir, you're robb'd; for shame, put on
       your gown;
       Your heart is burst, you have lost half your soul;
       Even now, now, very now, an old black ram
       Is topping your white ewe. Arise, arise; 95
       Awake the snorting citizens with the bell,
       Or else the devil will make a grandsire of you:
       Arise, I say.

     * Brabantio. What, have you lost your wits?

     * Roderigo. Most reverend signior, do you know my voice? 100

     * Brabantio. Not I. what are you?

     * Roderigo. My name is Roderigo.

     * Brabantio. The worser welcome:
       I have charged thee not to haunt about my doors:
       In honest plainness thou hast heard me say 105
       My daughter is not for thee; and now, in madness,
       Being full of supper and distempering draughts,
       Upon malicious bravery, dost thou come
       To start my quiet.

     * Roderigo. Sir, sir, sir,— 110

     * Brabantio. But thou must needs be sure
       My spirit and my place have in them power
       To make this bitter to thee.

     * Roderigo. Patience, good sir.

     * Brabantio. What tell'st thou me of robbing? this is Venice; 115
       My house is not a grange.

     * Roderigo. Most grave Brabantio,
       In simple and pure soul I come to you.

     * Iago. 'Zounds, sir, you are one of those that will not
       serve God, if the devil bid you. Because we come to 120
       do you service and you think we are ruffians, you'll
       have your daughter covered with a Barbary horse;
       you'll have your nephews neigh to you; you'll have
       coursers for cousins and gennets for germans.

     * Brabantio. What profane wretch art thou? 125

     * Iago. I am one, sir, that comes to tell you your daughter
       and the Moor are now making the beast with two backs.

     * Brabantio. Thou art a villain.

     * Iago. You are—a senator.

     * Brabantio. This thou shalt answer; I know thee, Roderigo. 130

     * Roderigo. Sir, I will answer any thing. But, I beseech you,
       If't be your pleasure and most wise consent,
       As partly I find it is, that your fair daughter,
       At this odd-even and dull watch o' the night,
       Transported, with no worse nor better guard 135
       But with a knave of common hire, a gondolier,
       To the gross clasps of a lascivious Moor—
       If this be known to you and your allowance,
       We then have done you bold and saucy wrongs;
       But if you know not this, my manners tell me 140
       We have your wrong rebuke. Do not believe
       That, from the sense of all civility,
       I thus would play and trifle with your reverence:
       Your daughter, if you have not given her leave,
       I say again, hath made a gross revolt; 145
       Tying her duty, beauty, wit and fortunes
       In an extravagant and wheeling stranger
       Of here and every where. Straight satisfy yourself:
       If she be in her chamber or your house,
       Let loose on me the justice of the state 150
       For thus deluding you.

     * Brabantio. Strike on the tinder, ho!
       Give me a taper! call up all my people!
       This accident is not unlike my dream:
       Belief of it oppresses me already. 155
       Light, I say! light!

   [Exit above]
     * Iago. Farewell; for I must leave you:
       It seems not meet, nor wholesome to my place,
       To be produced—as, if I stay, I shall— 160
       Against the Moor: for, I do know, the state,
       However this may gall him with some cheque,
       Cannot with safety cast him, for he's embark'd
       With such loud reason to the Cyprus wars,
       Which even now stand in act, that, for their souls, 165
       Another of his fathom they have none,
       To lead their business: in which regard,
       Though I do hate him as I do hell-pains.
       Yet, for necessity of present life,
       I must show out a flag and sign of love, 170
       Which is indeed but sign. That you shall surely find him,
       Lead to the Sagittary the raised search;
       And there will I be with him. So, farewell.

   [Exit]

   [Enter, below, BRABANTIO, and Servants with torches]
     * Brabantio. It is too true an evil: gone she is;
       And what's to come of my despised time
       Is nought but bitterness. Now, Roderigo,
       Where didst thou see her? O unhappy girl!
       With the Moor, say'st thou? Who would be a father! 180
       How didst thou know 'twas she? O she deceives me
       Past thought! What said she to you? Get more tapers:
       Raise all my kindred. Are they married, think you?

     * Roderigo. Truly, I think they are.

     * Brabantio. O heaven! How got she out? O treason of the blood! 185
       Fathers, from hence trust not your daughters' minds
       By what you see them act. Is there not charms
       By which the property of youth and maidhood
       May be abused? Have you not read, Roderigo,
       Of some such thing? 190

     * Roderigo. Yes, sir, I have indeed.

     * Brabantio. Call up my brother. O, would you had had her!
       Some one way, some another. Do you know
       Where we may apprehend her and the Moor?

     * Roderigo. I think I can discover him, if you please, 195
       To get good guard and go along with me.

     * Brabantio. Pray you, lead on. At every house I'll call;
       I may command at most. Get weapons, ho!
       And raise some special officers of night.
       On, good Roderigo: I'll deserve your pains. 200

   [Exeunt]

   Act I, Scene 2

   Another street.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   [Enter OTHELLO, IAGO, and Attendants with torches]
     * Iago. Though in the trade of war I have slain men,
       Yet do I hold it very stuff o' the conscience
       To do no contrived murder: I lack iniquity 205
       Sometimes to do me service: nine or ten times
       I had thought to have yerk'd him here under the ribs.

     * Othello. 'Tis better as it is.

     * Iago. Nay, but he prated,
       And spoke such scurvy and provoking terms 210
       Against your honour
       That, with the little godliness I have,
       I did full hard forbear him. But, I pray you, sir,
       Are you fast married? Be assured of this,
       That the magnifico is much beloved, 215
       And hath in his effect a voice potential
       As double as the duke's: he will divorce you;
       Or put upon you what restraint and grievance
       The law, with all his might to enforce it on,
       Will give him cable. 220

     * Othello. Let him do his spite:
       My services which I have done the signiory
       Shall out-tongue his complaints. 'Tis yet to know,—
       Which, when I know that boasting is an honour,
       I shall promulgate—I fetch my life and being 225
       From men of royal siege, and my demerits
       May speak unbonneted to as proud a fortune
       As this that I have reach'd: for know, Iago,
       But that I love the gentle Desdemona,
       I would not my unhoused free condition 230
       Put into circumscription and confine
       For the sea's worth. But, look! what lights come yond?

     * Iago. Those are the raised father and his friends:
       You were best go in.

     * Othello. Not I. I must be found: 235
       My parts, my title and my perfect soul
       Shall manifest me rightly. Is it they?

     * Iago. By Janus, I think no.

   [Enter CASSIO, and certain Officers with torches]
     * Othello. The servants of the duke, and my lieutenant. 240
       The goodness of the night upon you, friends!
       What is the news?

     * Cassio. The duke does greet you, general,
       And he requires your haste-post-haste appearance,
       Even on the instant. 245

     * Othello. What is the matter, think you?

     * Cassio. Something from Cyprus as I may divine:
       It is a business of some heat: the galleys
       Have sent a dozen sequent messengers
       This very night at one another's heels, 250
       And many of the consuls, raised and met,
       Are at the duke's already: you have been
       hotly call'd for;
       When, being not at your lodging to be found,
       The senate hath sent about three several guests 255
       To search you out.

     * Othello. 'Tis well I am found by you.
       I will but spend a word here in the house,
       And go with you.

   [Exit]
     * Cassio. Ancient, what makes he here?

     * Iago. 'Faith, he to-night hath boarded a land carack:
       If it prove lawful prize, he's made for ever.

     * Cassio. I do not understand.

     * Iago. He's married. 265

     * Cassio. To who?

   [Re-enter OTHELLO]
     * Iago. Marry, to—Come, captain, will you go?

     * Othello. Have with you.

     * Cassio. Here comes another troop to seek for you. 270

     * Iago. It is Brabantio. General, be advised;
       He comes to bad intent.

   [Enter BRABANTIO, RODERIGO, and Officers with torches and weapons]
     * Othello. Holla! stand there!

     * Roderigo. Signior, it is the Moor. 275

     * Brabantio. Down with him, thief!

   [They draw on both sides]
     * Iago. You, Roderigo! come, sir, I am for you.

     * Othello. Keep up your bright swords, for the dew will rust them.
       Good signior, you shall more command with years 280
       Than with your weapons.

     * Brabantio. O thou foul thief, where hast thou stow'd my daughter?
       Damn'd as thou art, thou hast enchanted her;
       For I'll refer me to all things of sense,
       If she in chains of magic were not bound, 285
       Whether a maid so tender, fair and happy,
       So opposite to marriage that she shunned
       The wealthy curled darlings of our nation,
       Would ever have, to incur a general mock,
       Run from her guardage to the sooty bosom 290
       Of such a thing as thou, to fear, not to delight.
       Judge me the world, if 'tis not gross in sense
       That thou hast practised on her with foul charms,
       Abused her delicate youth with drugs or minerals
       That weaken motion: I'll have't disputed on; 295
       'Tis probable and palpable to thinking.
       I therefore apprehend and do attach thee
       For an abuser of the world, a practiser
       Of arts inhibited and out of warrant.
       Lay hold upon him: if he do resist, 300
       Subdue him at his peril.

     * Othello. Hold your hands,
       Both you of my inclining, and the rest:
       Were it my cue to fight, I should have known it
       Without a prompter. Where will you that I go 305
       To answer this your charge?

     * Brabantio. To prison, till fit time
       Of law and course of direct session
       Call thee to answer.

     * Othello. What if I do obey? 310
       How may the duke be therewith satisfied,
       Whose messengers are here about my side,
       Upon some present business of the state
       To bring me to him?

     * First Officer. 'Tis true, most worthy signior; 315
       The duke's in council and your noble self,
       I am sure, is sent for.

     * Brabantio. How! the duke in council!
       In this time of the night! Bring him away:
       Mine's not an idle cause: the duke himself, 320
       Or any of my brothers of the state,
       Cannot but feel this wrong as 'twere their own;
       For if such actions may have passage free,
       Bond-slaves and pagans shall our statesmen be.

   [Exeunt]

   Act I, Scene 3

   A council-chamber.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   [The DUKE and Senators sitting at a table; Officers attending]
     * Duke of Venice. There is no composition in these news
       That gives them credit.

     * First Senator. Indeed, they are disproportion'd;
       My letters say a hundred and seven galleys. 330

     * Duke of Venice. And mine, a hundred and forty.

     * Second Senator. And mine, two hundred:
       But though they jump not on a just account,—
       As in these cases, where the aim reports,
       'Tis oft with difference—yet do they all confirm 335
       A Turkish fleet, and bearing up to Cyprus.

     * Duke of Venice. Nay, it is possible enough to judgment:
       I do not so secure me in the error,
       But the main article I do approve
       In fearful sense. 340

     * Sailor. [Within] What, ho! what, ho! what, ho!

     * First Officer. A messenger from the galleys.

   [Enter a Sailor]
     * Duke of Venice. Now, what's the business?

     * Sailor. The Turkish preparation makes for Rhodes; 345
       So was I bid report here to the state
       By Signior Angelo.

     * Duke of Venice. How say you by this change?

     * First Senator. This cannot be,
       By no assay of reason: 'tis a pageant, 350
       To keep us in false gaze. When we consider
       The importancy of Cyprus to the Turk,
       And let ourselves again but understand,
       That as it more concerns the Turk than Rhodes,
       So may he with more facile question bear it, 355
       For that it stands not in such warlike brace,
       But altogether lacks the abilities
       That Rhodes is dress'd in: if we make thought of this,
       We must not think the Turk is so unskilful
       To leave that latest which concerns him first, 360
       Neglecting an attempt of ease and gain,
       To wake and wage a danger profitless.

     * Duke of Venice. Nay, in all confidence, he's not for Rhodes.

     * First Officer. Here is more news.

   [Enter a Messenger]
     * Messenger. The Ottomites, reverend and gracious,
       Steering with due course towards the isle of Rhodes,
       Have there injointed them with an after fleet.

     * First Senator. Ay, so I thought. How many, as you guess?

     * Messenger. Of thirty sail: and now they do restem 370
       Their backward course, bearing with frank appearance
       Their purposes toward Cyprus. Signior Montano,
       Your trusty and most valiant servitor,
       With his free duty recommends you thus,
       And prays you to believe him. 375

     * Duke of Venice. 'Tis certain, then, for Cyprus.
       Marcus Luccicos, is not he in town?

     * First Senator. He's now in Florence.

     * Duke of Venice. Write from us to him; post-post-haste dispatch.

     * First Senator. Here comes Brabantio and the valiant Moor. 380

   [Enter BRABANTIO, OTHELLO, IAGO, RODERIGO, and Officers]
     * Duke of Venice. Valiant Othello, we must straight employ you
       Against the general enemy Ottoman.
       [To BRABANTIO]
       I did not see you; welcome, gentle signior; 385
       We lack'd your counsel and your help tonight.

     * Brabantio. So did I yours. Good your grace, pardon me;
       Neither my place nor aught I heard of business
       Hath raised me from my bed, nor doth the general care
       Take hold on me, for my particular grief 390
       Is of so flood-gate and o'erbearing nature
       That it engluts and swallows other sorrows
       And it is still itself.

     * Duke of Venice. Why, what's the matter?

     * Brabantio. My daughter! O, my daughter! 395

     * Duke of Venice. [with Senator] Dead?

     * Brabantio. Ay, to me;
       She is abused, stol'n from me, and corrupted
       By spells and medicines bought of mountebanks;
       For nature so preposterously to err, 400
       Being not deficient, blind, or lame of sense,
       Sans witchcraft could not.

     * Duke of Venice. Whoe'er he be that in this foul proceeding
       Hath thus beguiled your daughter of herself
       And you of her, the bloody book of law 405
       You shall yourself read in the bitter letter
       After your own sense, yea, though our proper son
       Stood in your action.

     * Brabantio. Humbly I thank your grace.
       Here is the man, this Moor, whom now, it seems, 410
       Your special mandate for the state-affairs
       Hath hither brought.

     * Duke of Venice. [with Senator] We are very sorry for't.

     * Duke of Venice. [To OTHELLO] What, in your own part, can you say to
       this?

     * Brabantio. Nothing, but this is so. 415

     * Othello. Most potent, grave, and reverend signiors,
       My very noble and approved good masters,
       That I have ta'en away this old man's daughter,
       It is most true; true, I have married her:
       The very head and front of my offending 420
       Hath this extent, no more. Rude am I in my speech,
       And little bless'd with the soft phrase of peace:
       For since these arms of mine had seven years' pith,
       Till now some nine moons wasted, they have used
       Their dearest action in the tented field, 425
       And little of this great world can I speak,
       More than pertains to feats of broil and battle,
       And therefore little shall I grace my cause
       In speaking for myself. Yet, by your gracious patience,
       I will a round unvarnish'd tale deliver 430
       Of my whole course of love; what drugs, what charms,
       What conjuration and what mighty magic,
       For such proceeding I am charged withal,
       I won his daughter.

     * Brabantio. A maiden never bold; 435
       Of spirit so still and quiet, that her motion
       Blush'd at herself; and she, in spite of nature,
       Of years, of country, credit, every thing,
       To fall in love with what she fear'd to look on!
       It is a judgment maim'd and most imperfect 440
       That will confess perfection so could err
       Against all rules of nature, and must be driven
       To find out practises of cunning hell,
       Why this should be. I therefore vouch again
       That with some mixtures powerful o'er the blood, 445
       Or with some dram conjured to this effect,
       He wrought upon her.

     * Duke of Venice. To vouch this, is no proof,
       Without more wider and more overt test
       Than these thin habits and poor likelihoods 450
       Of modern seeming do prefer against him.

     * First Senator. But, Othello, speak:
       Did you by indirect and forced courses
       Subdue and poison this young maid's affections?
       Or came it by request and such fair question 455
       As soul to soul affordeth?

     * Othello. I do beseech you,
       Send for the lady to the Sagittary,
       And let her speak of me before her father:
       If you do find me foul in her report, 460
       The trust, the office I do hold of you,
       Not only take away, but let your sentence
       Even fall upon my life.

     * Duke of Venice. Fetch Desdemona hither.

     * Othello. Ancient, conduct them: you best know the place. 465
       [Exeunt IAGO and Attendants]
       And, till she come, as truly as to heaven
       I do confess the vices of my blood,
       So justly to your grave ears I'll present
       How I did thrive in this fair lady's love, 470
       And she in mine.

     * Duke of Venice. Say it, Othello.

     * Othello. Her father loved me; oft invited me;
       Still question'd me the story of my life,
       From year to year, the battles, sieges, fortunes, 475
       That I have passed.
       I ran it through, even from my boyish days,
       To the very moment that he bade me tell it;
       Wherein I spake of most disastrous chances,
       Of moving accidents by flood and field 480
       Of hair-breadth scapes i' the imminent deadly breach,
       Of being taken by the insolent foe
       And sold to slavery, of my redemption thence
       And portance in my travels' history:
       Wherein of antres vast and deserts idle, 485
       Rough quarries, rocks and hills whose heads touch heaven
       It was my hint to speak,—such was the process;
       And of the Cannibals that each other eat,
       The Anthropophagi and men whose heads
       Do grow beneath their shoulders. This to hear 490
       Would Desdemona seriously incline:
       But still the house-affairs would draw her thence:
       Which ever as she could with haste dispatch,
       She'ld come again, and with a greedy ear
       Devour up my discourse: which I observing, 495
       Took once a pliant hour, and found good means
       To draw from her a prayer of earnest heart
       That I would all my pilgrimage dilate,
       Whereof by parcels she had something heard,
       But not intentively: I did consent, 500
       And often did beguile her of her tears,
       When I did speak of some distressful stroke
       That my youth suffer'd. My story being done,
       She gave me for my pains a world of sighs:
       She swore, in faith, twas strange, 'twas passing strange, 505
       'Twas pitiful, 'twas wondrous pitiful:
       She wish'd she had not heard it, yet she wish'd
       That heaven had made her such a man: she thank'd me,
       And bade me, if I had a friend that loved her,
       I should but teach him how to tell my story. 510
       And that would woo her. Upon this hint I spake:
       She loved me for the dangers I had pass'd,
       And I loved her that she did pity them.
       This only is the witchcraft I have used:
       Here comes the lady; let her witness it. 515

   [Enter DESDEMONA, IAGO, and Attendants]
     * Duke of Venice. I think this tale would win my daughter too.
       Good Brabantio,
       Take up this mangled matter at the best:
       Men do their broken weapons rather use 520
       Than their bare hands.

     * Brabantio. I pray you, hear her speak:
       If she confess that she was half the wooer,
       Destruction on my head, if my bad blame
       Light on the man! Come hither, gentle mistress: 525
       Do you perceive in all this noble company
       Where most you owe obedience?

     * Desdemona. My noble father,
       I do perceive here a divided duty:
       To you I am bound for life and education; 530
       My life and education both do learn me
       How to respect you; you are the lord of duty;
       I am hitherto your daughter: but here's my husband,
       And so much duty as my mother show'd
       To you, preferring you before her father, 535
       So much I challenge that I may profess
       Due to the Moor my lord.

     * Brabantio. God be wi' you! I have done.
       Please it your grace, on to the state-affairs:
       I had rather to adopt a child than get it. 540
       Come hither, Moor:
       I here do give thee that with all my heart
       Which, but thou hast already, with all my heart
       I would keep from thee. For your sake, jewel,
       I am glad at soul I have no other child: 545
       For thy escape would teach me tyranny,
       To hang clogs on them. I have done, my lord.

     * Duke of Venice. Let me speak like yourself, and lay a sentence,
       Which, as a grise or step, may help these lovers
       Into your favour. 550
       When remedies are past, the griefs are ended
       By seeing the worst, which late on hopes depended.
       To mourn a mischief that is past and gone
       Is the next way to draw new mischief on.
       What cannot be preserved when fortune takes 555
       Patience her injury a mockery makes.
       The robb'd that smiles steals something from the thief;
       He robs himself that spends a bootless grief.

     * Brabantio. So let the Turk of Cyprus us beguile;
       We lose it not, so long as we can smile. 560
       He bears the sentence well that nothing bears
       But the free comfort which from thence he hears,
       But he bears both the sentence and the sorrow
       That, to pay grief, must of poor patience borrow.
       These sentences, to sugar, or to gall, 565
       Being strong on both sides, are equivocal:
       But words are words; I never yet did hear
       That the bruised heart was pierced through the ear.
       I humbly beseech you, proceed to the affairs of state.

     * Duke of Venice. The Turk with a most mighty preparation makes for
       570
       Cyprus. Othello, the fortitude of the place is best
       known to you; and though we have there a substitute
       of most allowed sufficiency, yet opinion, a
       sovereign mistress of effects, throws a more safer
       voice on you: you must therefore be content to 575
       slubber the gloss of your new fortunes with this
       more stubborn and boisterous expedition.

     * Othello. The tyrant custom, most grave senators,
       Hath made the flinty and steel couch of war
       My thrice-driven bed of down: I do agnise 580
       A natural and prompt alacrity
       I find in hardness, and do undertake
       These present wars against the Ottomites.
       Most humbly therefore bending to your state,
       I crave fit disposition for my wife. 585
       Due reference of place and exhibition,
       With such accommodation and besort
       As levels with her breeding.

     * Duke of Venice. If you please,
       Be't at her father's. 590

     * Brabantio. I'll not have it so.

     * Othello. Nor I.

     * Desdemona. Nor I; I would not there reside,
       To put my father in impatient thoughts
       By being in his eye. Most gracious duke, 595
       To my unfolding lend your prosperous ear;
       And let me find a charter in your voice,
       To assist my simpleness.

     * Duke of Venice. What would You, Desdemona?

     * Desdemona. That I did love the Moor to live with him, 600
       My downright violence and storm of fortunes
       May trumpet to the world: my heart's subdued
       Even to the very quality of my lord:
       I saw Othello's visage in his mind,
       And to his honour and his valiant parts 605
       Did I my soul and fortunes consecrate.
       So that, dear lords, if I be left behind,
       A moth of peace, and he go to the war,
       The rites for which I love him are bereft me,
       And I a heavy interim shall support 610
       By his dear absence. Let me go with him.

     * Othello. Let her have your voices.
       Vouch with me, heaven, I therefore beg it not,
       To please the palate of my appetite,
       Nor to comply with heat—the young affects 615
       In me defunct—and proper satisfaction.
       But to be free and bounteous to her mind:
       And heaven defend your good souls, that you think
       I will your serious and great business scant
       For she is with me: no, when light-wing'd toys 620
       Of feather'd Cupid seal with wanton dullness
       My speculative and officed instruments,
       That my disports corrupt and taint my business,
       Let housewives make a skillet of my helm,
       And all indign and base adversities 625
       Make head against my estimation!

     * Duke of Venice. Be it as you shall privately determine,
       Either for her stay or going: the affair cries haste,
       And speed must answer it.

     * First Senator. You must away to-night. 630

     * Othello. With all my heart.

     * Duke of Venice. At nine i' the morning here we'll meet again.
       Othello, leave some officer behind,
       And he shall our commission bring to you;
       With such things else of quality and respect 635
       As doth import you.

     * Othello. So please your grace, my ancient;
       A man he is of honest and trust:
       To his conveyance I assign my wife,
       With what else needful your good grace shall think 640
       To be sent after me.

     * Duke of Venice. Let it be so.
       Good night to every one.
       [To BRABANTIO]
       And, noble signior, 645
       If virtue no delighted beauty lack,
       Your son-in-law is far more fair than black.

     * First Senator. Adieu, brave Moor, use Desdemona well.

     * Brabantio. Look to her, Moor, if thou hast eyes to see:
       She has deceived her father, and may thee. 650

   [Exeunt DUKE OF VENICE, Senators, Officers, &c]
     * Othello. My life upon her faith! Honest Iago,
       My Desdemona must I leave to thee:
       I prithee, let thy wife attend on her:
       And bring them after in the best advantage. 655
       Come, Desdemona: I have but an hour
       Of love, of worldly matters and direction,
       To spend with thee: we must obey the time.

   [Exeunt OTHELLO and DESDEMONA]
     * Roderigo. Iago,— 660

     * Iago. What say'st thou, noble heart?

     * Roderigo. What will I do, thinkest thou?

     * Iago. Why, go to bed, and sleep.

     * Roderigo. I will incontinently drown myself.

     * Iago. If thou dost, I shall never love thee after. Why, 665
       thou silly gentleman!

     * Roderigo. It is silliness to live when to live is torment; and
       then have we a prescription to die when death is our physician.

     * Iago. O villainous! I have looked upon the world for four
       times seven years; and since I could distinguish 670
       betwixt a benefit and an injury, I never found man
       that knew how to love himself. Ere I would say, I
       would drown myself for the love of a guinea-hen, I
       would change my humanity with a baboon.

     * Roderigo. What should I do? I confess it is my shame to be so 675
       fond; but it is not in my virtue to amend it.

     * Iago. Virtue! a fig! 'tis in ourselves that we are thus
       or thus. Our bodies are our gardens, to the which
       our wills are gardeners: so that if we will plant
       nettles, or sow lettuce, set hyssop and weed up 680
       thyme, supply it with one gender of herbs, or
       distract it with many, either to have it sterile
       with idleness, or manured with industry, why, the
       power and corrigible authority of this lies in our
       wills. If the balance of our lives had not one 685
       scale of reason to poise another of sensuality, the
       blood and baseness of our natures would conduct us
       to most preposterous conclusions: but we have
       reason to cool our raging motions, our carnal
       stings, our unbitted lusts, whereof I take this that 690
       you call love to be a sect or scion.

     * Roderigo. It cannot be.

     * Iago. It is merely a lust of the blood and a permission of
       the will. Come, be a man. Drown thyself! drown
       cats and blind puppies. I have professed me thy 695
       friend and I confess me knit to thy deserving with
       cables of perdurable toughness; I could never
       better stead thee than now. Put money in thy
       purse; follow thou the wars; defeat thy favour with
       an usurped beard; I say, put money in thy purse. It 700
       cannot be that Desdemona should long continue her
       love to the Moor,— put money in thy purse,—nor he
       his to her: it was a violent commencement, and thou
       shalt see an answerable sequestration:—put but
       money in thy purse. These Moors are changeable in 705
       their wills: fill thy purse with money:—the food
       that to him now is as luscious as locusts, shall be
       to him shortly as bitter as coloquintida. She must
       change for youth: when she is sated with his body,
       she will find the error of her choice: she must 710
       have change, she must: therefore put money in thy
       purse. If thou wilt needs damn thyself, do it a
       more delicate way than drowning. Make all the money
       thou canst: if sanctimony and a frail vow betwixt
       an erring barbarian and a supersubtle Venetian not 715
       too hard for my wits and all the tribe of hell, thou
       shalt enjoy her; therefore make money. A pox of
       drowning thyself! it is clean out of the way: seek
       thou rather to be hanged in compassing thy joy than
       to be drowned and go without her. 720

     * Roderigo. Wilt thou be fast to my hopes, if I depend on
       the issue?

     * Iago. Thou art sure of me:—go, make money:—I have told
       thee often, and I re-tell thee again and again, I
       hate the Moor: my cause is hearted; thine hath no 725
       less reason. Let us be conjunctive in our revenge
       against him: if thou canst cuckold him, thou dost
       thyself a pleasure, me a sport. There are many
       events in the womb of time which will be delivered.
       Traverse! go, provide thy money. We will have more 730
       of this to-morrow. Adieu.

     * Roderigo. Where shall we meet i' the morning?

     * Iago. At my lodging.

     * Roderigo. I'll be with thee betimes.

     * Iago. Go to; farewell. Do you hear, Roderigo? 735

     * Roderigo. What say you?

     * Iago. No more of drowning, do you hear?

     * Roderigo. I am changed: I'll go sell all my land.

   [Exit]
     * Iago. Thus do I ever make my fool my purse: 740
       For I mine own gain'd knowledge should profane,
       If I would time expend with such a snipe.
       But for my sport and profit. I hate the Moor:
       And it is thought abroad, that 'twixt my sheets
       He has done my office: I know not if't be true; 745
       But I, for mere suspicion in that kind,
       Will do as if for surety. He holds me well;
       The better shall my purpose work on him.
       Cassio's a proper man: let me see now:
       To get his place and to plume up my will 750
       In double knavery—How, how? Let's see:—
       After some time, to abuse Othello's ear
       That he is too familiar with his wife.
       He hath a person and a smooth dispose
       To be suspected, framed to make women false. 755
       The Moor is of a free and open nature,
       That thinks men honest that but seem to be so,
       And will as tenderly be led by the nose
       As asses are.
       I have't. It is engender'd. Hell and night 760
       Must bring this monstrous birth to the world's light.

   [Exit]

   Act II, Scene 1

   A Sea-port in Cyprus. An open place near the quay.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   [Enter MONTANO and two Gentlemen]
     * Montano. What from the cape can you discern at sea?

     * First Gentleman. Nothing at all: it is a highwrought flood; 765
       I cannot, 'twixt the heaven and the main,
       Descry a sail.

     * Montano. Methinks the wind hath spoke aloud at land;
       A fuller blast ne'er shook our battlements:
       If it hath ruffian'd so upon the sea, 770
       What ribs of oak, when mountains melt on them,
       Can hold the mortise? What shall we hear of this?

     * Second Gentleman. A segregation of the Turkish fleet:
       For do but stand upon the foaming shore,
       The chidden billow seems to pelt the clouds; 775
       The wind-shaked surge, with high and monstrous mane,
       seems to cast water on the burning bear,
       And quench the guards of the ever-fixed pole:
       I never did like molestation view
       On the enchafed flood. 780

     * Montano. If that the Turkish fleet
       Be not enshelter'd and embay'd, they are drown'd:
       It is impossible they bear it out.

   [Enter a third Gentleman]
     * Third Gentleman. News, lads! our wars are done. 785
       The desperate tempest hath so bang'd the Turks,
       That their designment halts: a noble ship of Venice
       Hath seen a grievous wreck and sufferance
       On most part of their fleet.

     * Montano. How! is this true? 790

     * Third Gentleman. The ship is here put in,
       A Veronesa; Michael Cassio,
       Lieutenant to the warlike Moor Othello,
       Is come on shore: the Moor himself at sea,
       And is in full commission here for Cyprus. 795

     * Montano. I am glad on't; 'tis a worthy governor.

     * Third Gentleman. But this same Cassio, though he speak of comfort
       Touching the Turkish loss, yet he looks sadly,
       And prays the Moor be safe; for they were parted
       With foul and violent tempest. 800

     * Montano. Pray heavens he be;
       For I have served him, and the man commands
       Like a full soldier. Let's to the seaside, ho!
       As well to see the vessel that's come in
       As to throw out our eyes for brave Othello, 805
       Even till we make the main and the aerial blue
       An indistinct regard.

     * Third Gentleman. Come, let's do so:
       For every minute is expectancy
       Of more arrivance. 810

   [Enter CASSIO]
     * Cassio. Thanks, you the valiant of this warlike isle,
       That so approve the Moor! O, let the heavens
       Give him defence against the elements,
       For I have lost us him on a dangerous sea. 815

     * Montano. Is he well shipp'd?

     * Cassio. His bark is stoutly timber'd, his pilot
       Of very expert and approved allowance;
       Therefore my hopes, not surfeited to death,
       Stand in bold cure. 820

   [A cry within 'A sail, a sail, a sail!']

   [Enter a fourth Gentleman]
     * Cassio. What noise?

     * Fourth Gentleman. The town is empty; on the brow o' the sea
       Stand ranks of people, and they cry 'A sail!' 825

     * Cassio. My hopes do shape him for the governor.

   [Guns heard]
     * Second Gentleman. They do discharge their shot of courtesy:
       Our friends at least.

     * Cassio. I pray you, sir, go forth, 830
       And give us truth who 'tis that is arrived.

     * Second Gentleman. I shall.

   [Exit]
     * Montano. But, good lieutenant, is your general wived?

     * Cassio. Most fortunately: he hath achieved a maid 835
       That paragons description and wild fame;
       One that excels the quirks of blazoning pens,
       And in the essential vesture of creation
       Does tire the ingener.
       [Re-enter second Gentleman] 840
       How now! who has put in?

     * Second Gentleman. 'Tis one Iago, ancient to the general.

     * Cassio. Has had most favourable and happy speed:
       Tempests themselves, high seas, and howling winds,
       The gutter'd rocks and congregated sands— 845
       Traitors ensteep'd to clog the guiltless keel,—
       As having sense of beauty, do omit
       Their mortal natures, letting go safely by
       The divine Desdemona.

     * Montano. What is she? 850

     * Cassio. She that I spake of, our great captain's captain,
       Left in the conduct of the bold Iago,
       Whose footing here anticipates our thoughts
       A se'nnight's speed. Great Jove, Othello guard,
       And swell his sail with thine own powerful breath, 855
       That he may bless this bay with his tall ship,
       Make love's quick pants in Desdemona's arms,
       Give renew'd fire to our extincted spirits
       And bring all Cyprus comfort!
       [Enter DESDEMONA, EMILIA, IAGO, RODERIGO, and Attendants] 860
       O, behold,
       The riches of the ship is come on shore!
       Ye men of Cyprus, let her have your knees.
       Hail to thee, lady! and the grace of heaven,
       Before, behind thee, and on every hand, 865
       Enwheel thee round!

     * Desdemona. I thank you, valiant Cassio.
       What tidings can you tell me of my lord?

     * Cassio. He is not yet arrived: nor know I aught
       But that he's well and will be shortly here. 870

     * Desdemona. O, but I fear—How lost you company?

     * Cassio. The great contention of the sea and skies
       Parted our fellowship—But, hark! a sail.

   [Within 'A sail, a sail!' Guns heard]
     * Second Gentleman. They give their greeting to the citadel; 875
       This likewise is a friend.

     * Cassio. See for the news.
       [Exit Gentleman]
       Good ancient, you are welcome.
       [To EMILIA] 880
       Welcome, mistress.
       Let it not gall your patience, good Iago,
       That I extend my manners; 'tis my breeding
       That gives me this bold show of courtesy.

   [Kissing her]
     * Iago. Sir, would she give you so much of her lips
       As of her tongue she oft bestows on me,
       You'll have enough.

     * Desdemona. Alas, she has no speech.

     * Iago. In faith, too much; 890
       I find it still, when I have list to sleep:
       Marry, before your ladyship, I grant,
       She puts her tongue a little in her heart,
       And chides with thinking.

     * Emilia. You have little cause to say so. 895

     * Iago. Come on, come on; you are pictures out of doors,
       Bells in your parlors, wild-cats in your kitchens,
       Saints m your injuries, devils being offended,
       Players in your housewifery, and housewives' in your beds.

     * Desdemona. O, fie upon thee, slanderer! 900

     * Iago. Nay, it is true, or else I am a Turk:
       You rise to play and go to bed to work.

     * Emilia. You shall not write my praise.

     * Iago. No, let me not.

     * Desdemona. What wouldst thou write of me, if thou shouldst 905
       praise me?

     * Iago. O gentle lady, do not put me to't;
       For I am nothing, if not critical.

     * Desdemona. Come on assay. There's one gone to the harbour?

     * Iago. Ay, madam. 910

     * Desdemona. I am not merry; but I do beguile
       The thing I am, by seeming otherwise.
       Come, how wouldst thou praise me?

     * Iago. I am about it; but indeed my invention
       Comes from my pate as birdlime does from frize; 915
       It plucks out brains and all: but my Muse labours,
       And thus she is deliver'd.
       If she be fair and wise, fairness and wit,
       The one's for use, the other useth it.

     * Desdemona. Well praised! How if she be black and witty? 920

     * Iago. If she be black, and thereto have a wit,
       She'll find a white that shall her blackness fit.

     * Desdemona. Worse and worse.

     * Emilia. How if fair and foolish?

     * Iago. She never yet was foolish that was fair; 925
       For even her folly help'd her to an heir.

     * Desdemona. These are old fond paradoxes to make fools laugh i'
       the alehouse. What miserable praise hast thou for
       her that's foul and foolish?

     * Iago. There's none so foul and foolish thereunto, 930
       But does foul pranks which fair and wise ones do.

     * Desdemona. O heavy ignorance! thou praisest the worst best.
       But what praise couldst thou bestow on a deserving
       woman indeed, one that, in the authority of her
       merit, did justly put on the vouch of very malice itself? 935

     * Iago. She that was ever fair and never proud,
       Had tongue at will and yet was never loud,
       Never lack'd gold and yet went never gay,
       Fled from her wish and yet said 'Now I may,'
       She that being anger'd, her revenge being nigh, 940
       Bade her wrong stay and her displeasure fly,
       She that in wisdom never was so frail
       To change the cod's head for the salmon's tail;
       She that could think and ne'er disclose her mind,
       See suitors following and not look behind, 945
       She was a wight, if ever such wight were,—

     * Desdemona. To do what?

     * Iago. To suckle fools and chronicle small beer.

     * Desdemona. O most lame and impotent conclusion! Do not learn
       of him, Emilia, though he be thy husband. How say 950
       you, Cassio? is he not a most profane and liberal
       counsellor?

     * Cassio. He speaks home, madam: You may relish him more in
       the soldier than in the scholar.

     * Iago. [Aside] He takes her by the palm: ay, well said, 955
       whisper: with as little a web as this will I
       ensnare as great a fly as Cassio. Ay, smile upon
       her, do; I will gyve thee in thine own courtship.
       You say true; 'tis so, indeed: if such tricks as
       these strip you out of your lieutenantry, it had 960
       been better you had not kissed your three fingers so
       oft, which now again you are most apt to play the
       sir in. Very good; well kissed! an excellent
       courtesy! 'tis so, indeed. Yet again your fingers
       to your lips? would they were clyster-pipes for your sake! 965
       [Trumpet within]
       The Moor! I know his trumpet.

     * Cassio. 'Tis truly so.

     * Desdemona. Let's meet him and receive him.

     * Cassio. Lo, where he comes! 970

   [Enter OTHELLO and Attendants]
     * Othello. O my fair warrior!

     * Desdemona. My dear Othello!

     * Othello. It gives me wonder great as my content
       To see you here before me. O my soul's joy! 975
       If after every tempest come such calms,
       May the winds blow till they have waken'd death!
       And let the labouring bark climb hills of seas
       Olympus-high and duck again as low
       As hell's from heaven! If it were now to die, 980
       'Twere now to be most happy; for, I fear,
       My soul hath her content so absolute
       That not another comfort like to this
       Succeeds in unknown fate.

     * Desdemona. The heavens forbid 985
       But that our loves and comforts should increase,
       Even as our days do grow!

     * Othello. Amen to that, sweet powers!
       I cannot speak enough of this content;
       It stops me here; it is too much of joy: 990
       And this, and this, the greatest discords be
       [Kissing her]
       That e'er our hearts shall make!

     * Iago. [Aside] O, you are well tuned now!
       But I'll set down the pegs that make this music, 995
       As honest as I am.

     * Othello. Come, let us to the castle.
       News, friends; our wars are done, the Turks
       are drown'd.
       How does my old acquaintance of this isle? 1000
       Honey, you shall be well desired in Cyprus;
       I have found great love amongst them. O my sweet,
       I prattle out of fashion, and I dote
       In mine own comforts. I prithee, good Iago,
       Go to the bay and disembark my coffers: 1005
       Bring thou the master to the citadel;
       He is a good one, and his worthiness
       Does challenge much respect. Come, Desdemona,
       Once more, well met at Cyprus.

   [Exeunt OTHELLO, DESDEMONA, and Attendants]
     * Iago. Do thou meet me presently at the harbour. Come
       hither. If thou be'st valiant,— as, they say, base
       men being in love have then a nobility in their
       natures more than is native to them—list me. The
       lieutenant tonight watches on the court of 1015
       guard:—first, I must tell thee this—Desdemona is
       directly in love with him.

     * Roderigo. With him! why, 'tis not possible.

     * Iago. Lay thy finger thus, and let thy soul be instructed.
       Mark me with what violence she first loved the Moor, 1020
       but for bragging and telling her fantastical lies:
       and will she love him still for prating? let not
       thy discreet heart think it. Her eye must be fed;
       and what delight shall she have to look on the
       devil? When the blood is made dull with the act of 1025
       sport, there should be, again to inflame it and to
       give satiety a fresh appetite, loveliness in favour,
       sympathy in years, manners and beauties; all which
       the Moor is defective in: now, for want of these
       required conveniences, her delicate tenderness will 1030
       find itself abused, begin to heave the gorge,
       disrelish and abhor the Moor; very nature will
       instruct her in it and compel her to some second
       choice. Now, sir, this granted,—as it is a most
       pregnant and unforced position—who stands so 1035
       eminent in the degree of this fortune as Cassio
       does? a knave very voluble; no further
       conscionable than in putting on the mere form of
       civil and humane seeming, for the better compassing
       of his salt and most hidden loose affection? why, 1040
       none; why, none: a slipper and subtle knave, a
       finder of occasions, that has an eye can stamp and
       counterfeit advantages, though true advantage never
       present itself; a devilish knave. Besides, the
       knave is handsome, young, and hath all those 1045
       requisites in him that folly and green minds look
       after: a pestilent complete knave; and the woman
       hath found him already.

     * Roderigo. I cannot believe that in her; she's full of
       most blessed condition. 1050

     * Iago. Blessed fig's-end! the wine she drinks is made of
       grapes: if she had been blessed, she would never
       have loved the Moor. Blessed pudding! Didst thou
       not see her paddle with the palm of his hand? didst
       not mark that? 1055

     * Roderigo. Yes, that I did; but that was but courtesy.

     * Iago. Lechery, by this hand; an index and obscure prologue
       to the history of lust and foul thoughts. They met
       so near with their lips that their breaths embraced
       together. Villanous thoughts, Roderigo! when these 1060
       mutualities so marshal the way, hard at hand comes
       the master and main exercise, the incorporate
       conclusion, Pish! But, sir, be you ruled by me: I
       have brought you from Venice. Watch you to-night;
       for the command, I'll lay't upon you. Cassio knows 1065
       you not. I'll not be far from you: do you find
       some occasion to anger Cassio, either by speaking
       too loud, or tainting his discipline; or from what
       other course you please, which the time shall more
       favourably minister. 1070

     * Roderigo. Well.

     * Iago. Sir, he is rash and very sudden in choler, and haply
       may strike at you: provoke him, that he may; for
       even out of that will I cause these of Cyprus to
       mutiny; whose qualification shall come into no true 1075
       taste again but by the displanting of Cassio. So
       shall you have a shorter journey to your desires by
       the means I shall then have to prefer them; and the
       impediment most profitably removed, without the
       which there were no expectation of our prosperity. 1080

     * Roderigo. I will do this, if I can bring it to any
       opportunity.

     * Iago. I warrant thee. Meet me by and by at the citadel:
       I must fetch his necessaries ashore. Farewell.

     * Roderigo. Adieu. 1085

   [Exit]
     * Iago. That Cassio loves her, I do well believe it;
       That she loves him, 'tis apt and of great credit:
       The Moor, howbeit that I endure him not,
       Is of a constant, loving, noble nature, 1090
       And I dare think he'll prove to Desdemona
       A most dear husband. Now, I do love her too;
       Not out of absolute lust, though peradventure
       I stand accountant for as great a sin,
       But partly led to diet my revenge, 1095
       For that I do suspect the lusty Moor
       Hath leap'd into my seat; the thought whereof
       Doth, like a poisonous mineral, gnaw my inwards;
       And nothing can or shall content my soul
       Till I am even'd with him, wife for wife, 1100
       Or failing so, yet that I put the Moor
       At least into a jealousy so strong
       That judgment cannot cure. Which thing to do,
       If this poor trash of Venice, whom I trash
       For his quick hunting, stand the putting on, 1105
       I'll have our Michael Cassio on the hip,
       Abuse him to the Moor in the rank garb—
       For I fear Cassio with my night-cap too—
       Make the Moor thank me, love me and reward me.
       For making him egregiously an ass 1110
       And practising upon his peace and quiet
       Even to madness. 'Tis here, but yet confused:
       Knavery's plain face is never seen tin used.

   A street.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   [Enter a Herald with a proclamation; People following]
     * Herald. It is Othello's pleasure, our noble and valiant
       general, that, upon certain tidings now arrived,
       importing the mere perdition of the Turkish fleet,
       every man put himself into triumph; some to dance,
       some to make bonfires, each man to what sport and 1120
       revels his addiction leads him: for, besides these
       beneficial news, it is the celebration of his
       nuptial. So much was his pleasure should be
       proclaimed. All offices are open, and there is full
       liberty of feasting from this present hour of five 1125
       till the bell have told eleven. Heaven bless the
       isle of Cyprus and our noble general Othello!

   [Exeunt]

   Act II, Scene 3

   A hall in the castle.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   [Enter OTHELLO, DESDEMONA, CASSIO, and Attendants]
     * Othello. Good Michael, look you to the guard to-night: 1130
       Let's teach ourselves that honourable stop,
       Not to outsport discretion.

     * Cassio. Iago hath direction what to do;
       But, notwithstanding, with my personal eye
       Will I look to't. 1135

     * Othello. Iago is most honest.
       Michael, good night: to-morrow with your earliest
       Let me have speech with you.
       [To DESDEMONA]
       Come, my dear love, 1140
       The purchase made, the fruits are to ensue;
       That profit's yet to come 'tween me and you.
       Good night.

   [Exeunt OTHELLO, DESDEMONA, and Attendants]

   [Enter IAGO]
     * Cassio. Welcome, Iago; we must to the watch.

     * Iago. Not this hour, lieutenant; 'tis not yet ten o' the
       clock. Our general cast us thus early for the love
       of his Desdemona; who let us not therefore blame:
       he hath not yet made wanton the night with her; and 1150
       she is sport for Jove.

     * Cassio. She's a most exquisite lady.

     * Iago. And, I'll warrant her, fun of game.

     * Cassio. Indeed, she's a most fresh and delicate creature.

     * Iago. What an eye she has! methinks it sounds a parley of 1155
       provocation.

     * Cassio. An inviting eye; and yet methinks right modest.

     * Iago. And when she speaks, is it not an alarum to love?

     * Cassio. She is indeed perfection.

     * Iago. Well, happiness to their sheets! Come, lieutenant, I 1160
       have a stoup of wine; and here without are a brace
       of Cyprus gallants that would fain have a measure to
       the health of black Othello.

     * Cassio. Not to-night, good Iago: I have very poor and
       unhappy brains for drinking: I could well wish 1165
       courtesy would invent some other custom of
       entertainment.

     * Iago. O, they are our friends; but one cup: I'll drink for
       you.

     * Cassio. I have drunk but one cup to-night, and that was 1170
       craftily qualified too, and, behold, what innovation
       it makes here: I am unfortunate in the infirmity,
       and dare not task my weakness with any more.

     * Iago. What, man! 'tis a night of revels: the gallants
       desire it. 1175

     * Cassio. Where are they?

     * Iago. Here at the door; I pray you, call them in.

     * Cassio. I'll do't; but it dislikes me.

   [Exit]
     * Iago. If I can fasten but one cup upon him, 1180
       With that which he hath drunk to-night already,
       He'll be as full of quarrel and offence
       As my young mistress' dog. Now, my sick fool Roderigo,
       Whom love hath turn'd almost the wrong side out,
       To Desdemona hath to-night caroused 1185
       Potations pottle-deep; and he's to watch:
       Three lads of Cyprus, noble swelling spirits,
       That hold their honours in a wary distance,
       The very elements of this warlike isle,
       Have I to-night fluster'd with flowing cups, 1190
       And they watch too. Now, 'mongst this flock of drunkards,
       Am I to put our Cassio in some action
       That may offend the isle.—But here they come:
       If consequence do but approve my dream,
       My boat sails freely, both with wind and stream. 1195

   [Re-enter CASSIO; with him MONTANO and Gentlemen; servants following
   with wine]
     * Cassio. 'Fore God, they have given me a rouse already.

     * Montano. Good faith, a little one; not past a pint, as I am
       a soldier.

     * Iago. Some wine, ho! 1200
       [Sings]
       And let me the canakin clink, clink;
       And let me the canakin clink
       A soldier's a man;
       A life's but a span; 1205
       Why, then, let a soldier drink.
       Some wine, boys!

     * Cassio. 'Fore God, an excellent song.

     * Iago. I learned it in England, where, indeed, they are
       most potent in potting: your Dane, your German, and 1210
       your swag-bellied Hollander—Drink, ho!—are nothing
       to your English.

     * Cassio. Is your Englishman so expert in his drinking?

     * Iago. Why, he drinks you, with facility, your Dane dead
       drunk; he sweats not to overthrow your Almain; he 1215
       gives your Hollander a vomit, ere the next pottle
       can be filled.

     * Cassio. To the health of our general!

     * Montano. I am for it, lieutenant; and I'll do you justice.

     * Iago. O sweet England! 1220
       King Stephen was a worthy peer,
       His breeches cost him but a crown;
       He held them sixpence all too dear,
       With that he call'd the tailor lown.
       He was a wight of high renown, 1225
       And thou art but of low degree:
       'Tis pride that pulls the country down;
       Then take thine auld cloak about thee.
       Some wine, ho!

     * Cassio. Why, this is a more exquisite song than the other. 1230

     * Iago. Will you hear't again?

     * Cassio. No; for I hold him to be unworthy of his place that
       does those things. Well, God's above all; and there
       be souls must be saved, and there be souls must not be saved.

     * Iago. It's true, good lieutenant. 1235

     * Cassio. For mine own part,—no offence to the general, nor
       any man of quality,—I hope to be saved.

     * Iago. And so do I too, lieutenant.

     * Cassio. Ay, but, by your leave, not before me; the
       lieutenant is to be saved before the ancient. Let's 1240
       have no more of this; let's to our affairs.—Forgive
       us our sins!—Gentlemen, let's look to our business.
       Do not think, gentlemen. I am drunk: this is my
       ancient; this is my right hand, and this is my left:
       I am not drunk now; I can stand well enough, and 1245
       speak well enough.

     * All. Excellent well.

     * Cassio. Why, very well then; you must not think then that I am
       drunk.

   [Exit]
     * Montano. To the platform, masters; come, let's set the watch. 1250

     * Iago. You see this fellow that is gone before;
       He is a soldier fit to stand by Caesar
       And give direction: and do but see his vice;
       'Tis to his virtue a just equinox,
       The one as long as the other: 'tis pity of him. 1255
       I fear the trust Othello puts him in.
       On some odd time of his infirmity,
       Will shake this island.

     * Montano. But is he often thus?

     * Iago. 'Tis evermore the prologue to his sleep: 1260
       He'll watch the horologe a double set,
       If drink rock not his cradle.

     * Montano. It were well
       The general were put in mind of it.
       Perhaps he sees it not; or his good nature 1265
       Prizes the virtue that appears in Cassio,
       And looks not on his evils: is not this true?

   [Enter RODERIGO]
     * Iago. [Aside to him] How now, Roderigo!
       I pray you, after the lieutenant; go. 1270

   [Exit RODERIGO]
     * Montano. And 'tis great pity that the noble Moor
       Should hazard such a place as his own second
       With one of an ingraft infirmity:
       It were an honest action to say 1275
       So to the Moor.

     * Iago. Not I, for this fair island:
       I do love Cassio well; and would do much
       To cure him of this evil—But, hark! what noise?

   [Cry within: 'Help! help!']

   [Re-enter CASSIO, driving in RODERIGO]
     * Cassio. You rogue! you rascal!

     * Montano. What's the matter, lieutenant?

     * Cassio. A knave teach me my duty!
       I'll beat the knave into a twiggen bottle. 1285

     * Roderigo. Beat me!

     * Cassio. Dost thou prate, rogue?

   [Striking RODERIGO]
     * Montano. Nay, good lieutenant;
       [Staying him] 1290
       I pray you, sir, hold your hand.

     * Cassio. Let me go, sir,
       Or I'll knock you o'er the mazzard.

     * Montano. Come, come,
       you're drunk. 1295

     * Cassio. Drunk!

   [They fight]
     * Iago. [Aside to RODERIGO] Away, I say; go out, and cry a mutiny.
       [Exit RODERIGO]
       Nay, good lieutenant,—alas, gentlemen;— 1300
       Help, ho!—Lieutenant,—sir,—Montano,—sir;
       Help, masters!—Here's a goodly watch indeed!
       [Bell rings]
       Who's that which rings the bell?—Diablo, ho!
       The town will rise: God's will, lieutenant, hold! 1305
       You will be shamed for ever.

   [Re-enter OTHELLO and Attendants]
     * Othello. What is the matter here?

     * Montano. 'Zounds, I bleed still; I am hurt to the death.

   [Faints]
     * Othello. Hold, for your lives!

     * Iago. Hold, ho! Lieutenant,—sir—Montano,—gentlemen,—
       Have you forgot all sense of place and duty?
       Hold! the general speaks to you; hold, hold, for shame!

     * Othello. Why, how now, ho! from whence ariseth this? 1315
       Are we turn'd Turks, and to ourselves do that
       Which heaven hath forbid the Ottomites?
       For Christian shame, put by this barbarous brawl:
       He that stirs next to carve for his own rage
       Holds his soul light; he dies upon his motion. 1320
       Silence that dreadful bell: it frights the isle
       From her propriety. What is the matter, masters?
       Honest Iago, that look'st dead with grieving,
       Speak, who began this? on thy love, I charge thee.

     * Iago. I do not know: friends all but now, even now, 1325
       In quarter, and in terms like bride and groom
       Devesting them for bed; and then, but now—
       As if some planet had unwitted men—
       Swords out, and tilting one at other's breast,
       In opposition bloody. I cannot speak 1330
       Any beginning to this peevish odds;
       And would in action glorious I had lost
       Those legs that brought me to a part of it!

     * Othello. How comes it, Michael, you are thus forgot?

     * Cassio. I pray you, pardon me; I cannot speak. 1335

     * Othello. Worthy Montano, you were wont be civil;
       The gravity and stillness of your youth
       The world hath noted, and your name is great
       In mouths of wisest censure: what's the matter,
       That you unlace your reputation thus 1340
       And spend your rich opinion for the name
       Of a night-brawler? give me answer to it.

     * Montano. Worthy Othello, I am hurt to danger:
       Your officer, Iago, can inform you,—
       While I spare speech, which something now 1345
       offends me,—
       Of all that I do know: nor know I aught
       By me that's said or done amiss this night;
       Unless self-charity be sometimes a vice,
       And to defend ourselves it be a sin 1350
       When violence assails us.

     * Othello. Now, by heaven,
       My blood begins my safer guides to rule;
       And passion, having my best judgment collied,
       Assays to lead the way: if I once stir, 1355
       Or do but lift this arm, the best of you
       Shall sink in my rebuke. Give me to know
       How this foul rout began, who set it on;
       And he that is approved in this offence,
       Though he had twinn'd with me, both at a birth, 1360
       Shall lose me. What! in a town of war,
       Yet wild, the people's hearts brimful of fear,
       To manage private and domestic quarrel,
       In night, and on the court and guard of safety!
       'Tis monstrous. Iago, who began't? 1365

     * Montano. If partially affined, or leagued in office,
       Thou dost deliver more or less than truth,
       Thou art no soldier.

     * Iago. Touch me not so near:
       I had rather have this tongue cut from my mouth 1370
       Than it should do offence to Michael Cassio;
       Yet, I persuade myself, to speak the truth
       Shall nothing wrong him. Thus it is, general.
       Montano and myself being in speech,
       There comes a fellow crying out for help: 1375
       And Cassio following him with determined sword,
       To execute upon him. Sir, this gentleman
       Steps in to Cassio, and entreats his pause:
       Myself the crying fellow did pursue,
       Lest by his clamour—as it so fell out— 1380
       The town might fall in fright: he, swift of foot,
       Outran my purpose; and I return'd the rather
       For that I heard the clink and fall of swords,
       And Cassio high in oath; which till to-night
       I ne'er might say before. When I came back— 1385
       For this was brief—I found them close together,
       At blow and thrust; even as again they were
       When you yourself did part them.
       More of this matter cannot I report:
       But men are men; the best sometimes forget: 1390
       Though Cassio did some little wrong to him,
       As men in rage strike those that wish them best,
       Yet surely Cassio, I believe, received
       From him that fled some strange indignity,
       Which patience could not pass. 1395

     * Othello. I know, Iago,
       Thy honesty and love doth mince this matter,
       Making it light to Cassio. Cassio, I love thee
       But never more be officer of mine.
       [Re-enter DESDEMONA, attended] 1400
       Look, if my gentle love be not raised up!
       I'll make thee an example.

     * Desdemona. What's the matter?

     * Othello. All's well now, sweeting; come away to bed.
       Sir, for your hurts, myself will be your surgeon: 1405
       Lead him off.
       [To MONTANO, who is led off]
       Iago, look with care about the town,
       And silence those whom this vile brawl distracted.
       Come, Desdemona: 'tis the soldiers' life 1410
       To have their balmy slumbers waked with strife.

   [Exeunt all but IAGO and CASSIO]
     * Iago. What, are you hurt, lieutenant?

     * Cassio. Ay, past all surgery.

     * Iago. Marry, heaven forbid! 1415

     * Cassio. Reputation, reputation, reputation! O, I have lost
       my reputation! I have lost the immortal part of
       myself, and what remains is bestial. My reputation,
       Iago, my reputation!

     * Iago. As I am an honest man, I thought you had received 1420
       some bodily wound; there is more sense in that than
       in reputation. Reputation is an idle and most false
       imposition: oft got without merit, and lost without
       deserving: you have lost no reputation at all,
       unless you repute yourself such a loser. What, man! 1425
       there are ways to recover the general again: you
       are but now cast in his mood, a punishment more in
       policy than in malice, even so as one would beat his
       offenceless dog to affright an imperious lion: sue
       to him again, and he's yours. 1430

     * Cassio. I will rather sue to be despised than to deceive so
       good a commander with so slight, so drunken, and so
       indiscreet an officer. Drunk? and speak parrot?
       and squabble? swagger? swear? and discourse
       fustian with one's own shadow? O thou invisible 1435
       spirit of wine, if thou hast no name to be known by,
       let us call thee devil!

     * Iago. What was he that you followed with your sword? What
       had he done to you?

     * Cassio. I know not. 1440

     * Iago. Is't possible?

     * Cassio. I remember a mass of things, but nothing distinctly;
       a quarrel, but nothing wherefore. O God, that men
       should put an enemy in their mouths to steal away
       their brains! that we should, with joy, pleasance 1445
       revel and applause, transform ourselves into beasts!

     * Iago. Why, but you are now well enough: how came you thus
       recovered?

     * Cassio. It hath pleased the devil drunkenness to give place
       to the devil wrath; one unperfectness shows me 1450
       another, to make me frankly despise myself.

     * Iago. Come, you are too severe a moraler: as the time,
       the place, and the condition of this country
       stands, I could heartily wish this had not befallen;
       but, since it is as it is, mend it for your own good. 1455

     * Cassio. I will ask him for my place again; he shall tell me
       I am a drunkard! Had I as many mouths as Hydra,
       such an answer would stop them all. To be now a
       sensible man, by and by a fool, and presently a
       beast! O strange! Every inordinate cup is 1460
       unblessed and the ingredient is a devil.

     * Iago. Come, come, good wine is a good familiar creature,
       if it be well used: exclaim no more against it.
       And, good lieutenant, I think you think I love you.

     * Cassio. I have well approved it, sir. I drunk! 1465

     * Iago. You or any man living may be drunk! at a time, man.
       I'll tell you what you shall do. Our general's wife
       is now the general: may say so in this respect, for
       that he hath devoted and given up himself to the
       contemplation, mark, and denotement of her parts and 1470
       graces: confess yourself freely to her; importune
       her help to put you in your place again: she is of
       so free, so kind, so apt, so blessed a disposition,
       she holds it a vice in her goodness not to do more
       than she is requested: this broken joint between 1475
       you and her husband entreat her to splinter; and, my
       fortunes against any lay worth naming, this
       crack of your love shall grow stronger than it was before.

     * Cassio. You advise me well.

     * Iago. I protest, in the sincerity of love and honest kindness. 1480

     * Cassio. I think it freely; and betimes in the morning I will
       beseech the virtuous Desdemona to undertake for me:
       I am desperate of my fortunes if they cheque me here.

     * Iago. You are in the right. Good night, lieutenant; I
       must to the watch. 1485

   [Exit]
     * Iago. And what's he then that says I play the villain?
       When this advice is free I give and honest,
       Probal to thinking and indeed the course 1490
       To win the Moor again? For 'tis most easy
       The inclining Desdemona to subdue
       In any honest suit: she's framed as fruitful
       As the free elements. And then for her
       To win the Moor—were't to renounce his baptism, 1495
       All seals and symbols of redeemed sin,
       His soul is so enfetter'd to her love,
       That she may make, unmake, do what she list,
       Even as her appetite shall play the god
       With his weak function. How am I then a villain 1500
       To counsel Cassio to this parallel course,
       Directly to his good? Divinity of hell!
       When devils will the blackest sins put on,
       They do suggest at first with heavenly shows,
       As I do now: for whiles this honest fool 1505
       Plies Desdemona to repair his fortunes
       And she for him pleads strongly to the Moor,
       I'll pour this pestilence into his ear,
       That she repeals him for her body's lust;
       And by how much she strives to do him good, 1510
       She shall undo her credit with the Moor.
       So will I turn her virtue into pitch,
       And out of her own goodness make the net
       That shall enmesh them all.
       [Re-enter RODERIGO] 1515
       How now, Roderigo!

     * Roderigo. I do follow here in the chase, not like a hound that
       hunts, but one that fills up the cry. My money is
       almost spent; I have been to-night exceedingly well
       cudgelled; and I think the issue will be, I shall 1520
       have so much experience for my pains, and so, with
       no money at all and a little more wit, return again to Venice.

     * Iago. How poor are they that have not patience!
       What wound did ever heal but by degrees?
       Thou know'st we work by wit, and not by witchcraft; 1525
       And wit depends on dilatory time.
       Does't not go well? Cassio hath beaten thee.
       And thou, by that small hurt, hast cashier'd Cassio:
       Though other things grow fair against the sun,
       Yet fruits that blossom first will first be ripe: 1530
       Content thyself awhile. By the mass, 'tis morning;
       Pleasure and action make the hours seem short.
       Retire thee; go where thou art billeted:
       Away, I say; thou shalt know more hereafter:
       Nay, get thee gone. 1535
       [Exit RODERIGO]
       Two things are to be done:
       My wife must move for Cassio to her mistress;
       I'll set her on;
       Myself the while to draw the Moor apart, 1540
       And bring him jump when he may Cassio find
       Soliciting his wife: ay, that's the way
       Dull not device by coldness and delay.

   [Exit]

   Act III, Scene 1

   Before the castle.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   [Enter CASSIO and some Musicians]
     * Cassio. Masters, play here; I will content your pains;
       Something that's brief; and bid 'Good morrow, general.'

   [Music]

   [Enter Clown]
     * Clown. Why masters, have your instruments been in Naples, 1550
       that they speak i' the nose thus?

     * First Musician. How, sir, how!

     * Clown. Are these, I pray you, wind-instruments?

     * First Musician. Ay, marry, are they, sir.

     * Clown. O, thereby hangs a tail. 1555

     * First Musician. Whereby hangs a tale, sir?

     * Clown. Marry. sir, by many a wind-instrument that I know.
       But, masters, here's money for you: and the general
       so likes your music, that he desires you, for love's
       sake, to make no more noise with it. 1560

     * First Musician. Well, sir, we will not.

     * Clown. If you have any music that may not be heard, to't
       again: but, as they say to hear music the general
       does not greatly care.

     * First Musician. We have none such, sir. 1565

     * Clown. Then put up your pipes in your bag, for I'll away:
       go; vanish into air; away!

   [Exeunt Musicians]
     * Cassio. Dost thou hear, my honest friend?

     * Clown. No, I hear not your honest friend; I hear you. 1570

     * Cassio. Prithee, keep up thy quillets. There's a poor piece
       of gold for thee: if the gentlewoman that attends
       the general's wife be stirring, tell her there's
       one Cassio entreats her a little favour of speech:
       wilt thou do this? 1575

     * Clown. She is stirring, sir: if she will stir hither, I
       shall seem to notify unto her.

     * Cassio. Do, good my friend.
       [Exit Clown]
       [Enter IAGO] 1580
       In happy time, Iago.

     * Iago. You have not been a-bed, then?

     * Cassio. Why, no; the day had broke
       Before we parted. I have made bold, Iago,
       To send in to your wife: my suit to her 1585
       Is, that she will to virtuous Desdemona
       Procure me some access.

     * Iago. I'll send her to you presently;
       And I'll devise a mean to draw the Moor
       Out of the way, that your converse and business 1590
       May be more free.

     * Cassio. I humbly thank you for't.
       [Exit IAGO]
       I never knew
       A Florentine more kind and honest. 1595

   [Enter EMILIA]
     * Emilia. Good morrow, good Lieutenant: I am sorry
       For your displeasure; but all will sure be well.
       The general and his wife are talking of it;
       And she speaks for you stoutly: the Moor replies, 1600
       That he you hurt is of great fame in Cyprus,
       And great affinity, and that in wholesome wisdom
       He might not but refuse you; but he protests he loves you
       And needs no other suitor but his likings
       To take the safest occasion by the front 1605
       To bring you in again.

     * Cassio. Yet, I beseech you,
       If you think fit, or that it may be done,
       Give me advantage of some brief discourse
       With Desdemona alone. 1610

     * Emilia. Pray you, come in;
       I will bestow you where you shall have time
       To speak your bosom freely.

     * Cassio. I am much bound to you.

   [Enter OTHELLO, IAGO, and Gentlemen]
     * Othello. These letters give, Iago, to the pilot;
       And by him do my duties to the senate:
       That done, I will be walking on the works;
       Repair there to me. 1620

     * Iago. Well, my good lord, I'll do't.

     * Othello. This fortification, gentlemen, shall we see't?

     * Gentleman. We'll wait upon your lordship.

   The garden of the castle.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   [Enter DESDEMONA, CASSIO, and EMILIA]
     * Desdemona. Be thou assured, good Cassio, I will do
       All my abilities in thy behalf.

     * Emilia. Good madam, do: I warrant it grieves my husband,
       As if the case were his.

     * Desdemona. O, that's an honest fellow. Do not doubt, Cassio, 1630
       But I will have my lord and you again
       As friendly as you were.

     * Cassio. Bounteous madam,
       Whatever shall become of Michael Cassio,
       He's never any thing but your true servant. 1635

     * Desdemona. I know't; I thank you. You do love my lord:
       You have known him long; and be you well assured
       He shall in strangeness stand no further off
       Than in a polite distance.

     * Cassio. Ay, but, lady, 1640
       That policy may either last so long,
       Or feed upon such nice and waterish diet,
       Or breed itself so out of circumstance,
       That, I being absent and my place supplied,
       My general will forget my love and service. 1645

     * Desdemona. Do not doubt that; before Emilia here
       I give thee warrant of thy place: assure thee,
       If I do vow a friendship, I'll perform it
       To the last article: my lord shall never rest;
       I'll watch him tame and talk him out of patience; 1650
       His bed shall seem a school, his board a shrift;
       I'll intermingle every thing he does
       With Cassio's suit: therefore be merry, Cassio;
       For thy solicitor shall rather die
       Than give thy cause away. 1655

     * Emilia. Madam, here comes my lord.

     * Cassio. Madam, I'll take my leave.

     * Desdemona. Why, stay, and hear me speak.

     * Cassio. Madam, not now: I am very ill at ease,
       Unfit for mine own purposes. 1660

     * Desdemona. Well, do your discretion.

   [Exit CASSIO]

   [Enter OTHELLO and IAGO]
     * Iago. Ha! I like not that.

     * Othello. What dost thou say? 1665

     * Iago. Nothing, my lord: or if—I know not what.

     * Othello. Was not that Cassio parted from my wife?

     * Iago. Cassio, my lord! No, sure, I cannot think it,
       That he would steal away so guilty-like,
       Seeing you coming. 1670

     * Othello. I do believe 'twas he.

     * Desdemona. How now, my lord!
       I have been talking with a suitor here,
       A man that languishes in your displeasure.

     * Othello. Who is't you mean? 1675

     * Desdemona. Why, your lieutenant, Cassio. Good my lord,
       If I have any grace or power to move you,
       His present reconciliation take;
       For if he be not one that truly loves you,
       That errs in ignorance and not in cunning, 1680
       I have no judgment in an honest face:
       I prithee, call him back.

     * Othello. Went he hence now?

     * Desdemona. Ay, sooth; so humbled
       That he hath left part of his grief with me, 1685
       To suffer with him. Good love, call him back.

     * Othello. Not now, sweet Desdemona; some other time.

     * Desdemona. But shall't be shortly?

     * Othello. The sooner, sweet, for you.

     * Desdemona. Shall't be to-night at supper? 1690

     * Othello. No, not to-night.

     * Desdemona. To-morrow dinner, then?

     * Othello. I shall not dine at home;
       I meet the captains at the citadel.

     * Desdemona. Why, then, to-morrow night; or Tuesday morn; 1695
       On Tuesday noon, or night; on Wednesday morn:
       I prithee, name the time, but let it not
       Exceed three days: in faith, he's penitent;
       And yet his trespass, in our common reason—
       Save that, they say, the wars must make examples 1700
       Out of their best—is not almost a fault
       To incur a private cheque. When shall he come?
       Tell me, Othello: I wonder in my soul,
       What you would ask me, that I should deny,
       Or stand so mammering on. What! Michael Cassio, 1705
       That came a-wooing with you, and so many a time,
       When I have spoke of you dispraisingly,
       Hath ta'en your part; to have so much to do
       To bring him in! Trust me, I could do much,—

     * Othello. Prithee, no more: let him come when he will; 1710
       I will deny thee nothing.

     * Desdemona. Why, this is not a boon;
       'Tis as I should entreat you wear your gloves,
       Or feed on nourishing dishes, or keep you warm,
       Or sue to you to do a peculiar profit 1715
       To your own person: nay, when I have a suit
       Wherein I mean to touch your love indeed,
       It shall be full of poise and difficult weight
       And fearful to be granted.

     * Othello. I will deny thee nothing: 1720
       Whereon, I do beseech thee, grant me this,
       To leave me but a little to myself.

     * Desdemona. Shall I deny you? no: farewell, my lord.

     * Othello. Farewell, my Desdemona: I'll come to thee straight.

     * Desdemona. Emilia, come. Be as your fancies teach you; 1725
       Whate'er you be, I am obedient.

   [Exeunt DESDEMONA and EMILIA]
     * Othello. Excellent wretch! Perdition catch my soul,
       But I do love thee! and when I love thee not,
       Chaos is come again. 1730

     * Iago. My noble lord—

     * Othello. What dost thou say, Iago?

     * Iago. Did Michael Cassio, when you woo'd my lady,
       Know of your love?

     * Othello. He did, from first to last: why dost thou ask? 1735

     * Iago. But for a satisfaction of my thought;
       No further harm.

     * Othello. Why of thy thought, Iago?

     * Iago. I did not think he had been acquainted with her.

     * Othello. O, yes; and went between us very oft. 1740

     * Iago. Indeed!

     * Othello. Indeed! ay, indeed: discern'st thou aught in that?
       Is he not honest?

     * Iago. Honest, my lord!

     * Othello. Honest! ay, honest. 1745

     * Iago. My lord, for aught I know.

     * Othello. What dost thou think?

     * Iago. Think, my lord!

     * Othello. Think, my lord!
       By heaven, he echoes me, 1750
       As if there were some monster in his thought
       Too hideous to be shown. Thou dost mean something:
       I heard thee say even now, thou likedst not that,
       When Cassio left my wife: what didst not like?
       And when I told thee he was of my counsel 1755
       In my whole course of wooing, thou criedst 'Indeed!'
       And didst contract and purse thy brow together,
       As if thou then hadst shut up in thy brain
       Some horrible conceit: if thou dost love me,
       Show me thy thought. 1760

     * Iago. My lord, you know I love you.

     * Othello. I think thou dost;
       And, for I know thou'rt full of love and honesty,
       And weigh'st thy words before thou givest them breath,
       Therefore these stops of thine fright me the more: 1765
       For such things in a false disloyal knave
       Are tricks of custom, but in a man that's just
       They are close delations, working from the heart
       That passion cannot rule.

     * Iago. For Michael Cassio, 1770
       I dare be sworn I think that he is honest.

     * Othello. I think so too.

     * Iago. Men should be what they seem;
       Or those that be not, would they might seem none!

     * Othello. Certain, men should be what they seem. 1775

     * Iago. Why, then, I think Cassio's an honest man.

     * Othello. Nay, yet there's more in this:
       I prithee, speak to me as to thy thinkings,
       As thou dost ruminate, and give thy worst of thoughts
       The worst of words. 1780

     * Iago. Good my lord, pardon me:
       Though I am bound to every act of duty,
       I am not bound to that all slaves are free to.
       Utter my thoughts? Why, say they are vile and false;
       As where's that palace whereinto foul things 1785
       Sometimes intrude not? who has a breast so pure,
       But some uncleanly apprehensions
       Keep leets and law-days and in session sit
       With meditations lawful?

     * Othello. Thou dost conspire against thy friend, Iago, 1790
       If thou but think'st him wrong'd and makest his ear
       A stranger to thy thoughts.

     * Iago. I do beseech you—
       Though I perchance am vicious in my guess,
       As, I confess, it is my nature's plague 1795
       To spy into abuses, and oft my jealousy
       Shapes faults that are not—that your wisdom yet,
       From one that so imperfectly conceits,
       Would take no notice, nor build yourself a trouble
       Out of his scattering and unsure observance. 1800
       It were not for your quiet nor your good,
       Nor for my manhood, honesty, or wisdom,
       To let you know my thoughts.

     * Othello. What dost thou mean?

     * Iago. Good name in man and woman, dear my lord, 1805
       Is the immediate jewel of their souls:
       Who steals my purse steals trash; 'tis something, nothing;
       'Twas mine, 'tis his, and has been slave to thousands:
       But he that filches from me my good name
       Robs me of that which not enriches him 1810
       And makes me poor indeed.

     * Othello. By heaven, I'll know thy thoughts.

     * Iago. You cannot, if my heart were in your hand;
       Nor shall not, whilst 'tis in my custody.

     * Othello. Ha! 1815

     * Iago. O, beware, my lord, of jealousy;
       It is the green-eyed monster which doth mock
       The meat it feeds on; that cuckold lives in bliss
       Who, certain of his fate, loves not his wronger;
       But, O, what damned minutes tells he o'er 1820
       Who dotes, yet doubts, suspects, yet strongly loves!

     * Othello. O misery!

     * Iago. Poor and content is rich and rich enough,
       But riches fineless is as poor as winter
       To him that ever fears he shall be poor. 1825
       Good heaven, the souls of all my tribe defend
       From jealousy!

     * Othello. Why, why is this?
       Think'st thou I'ld make a lie of jealousy,
       To follow still the changes of the moon 1830
       With fresh suspicions? No; to be once in doubt
       Is once to be resolved: exchange me for a goat,
       When I shall turn the business of my soul
       To such exsufflicate and blown surmises,
       Matching thy inference. 'Tis not to make me jealous 1835
       To say my wife is fair, feeds well, loves company,
       Is free of speech, sings, plays and dances well;
       Where virtue is, these are more virtuous:
       Nor from mine own weak merits will I draw
       The smallest fear or doubt of her revolt; 1840
       For she had eyes, and chose me. No, Iago;
       I'll see before I doubt; when I doubt, prove;
       And on the proof, there is no more but this,—
       Away at once with love or jealousy!

     * Iago. I am glad of it; for now I shall have reason 1845
       To show the love and duty that I bear you
       With franker spirit: therefore, as I am bound,
       Receive it from me. I speak not yet of proof.
       Look to your wife; observe her well with Cassio;
       Wear your eye thus, not jealous nor secure: 1850
       I would not have your free and noble nature,
       Out of self-bounty, be abused; look to't:
       I know our country disposition well;
       In Venice they do let heaven see the pranks
       They dare not show their husbands; their best conscience 1855
       Is not to leave't undone, but keep't unknown.

     * Othello. Dost thou say so?

     * Iago. She did deceive her father, marrying you;
       And when she seem'd to shake and fear your looks,
       She loved them most. 1860

     * Othello. And so she did.

     * Iago. Why, go to then;
       She that, so young, could give out such a seeming,
       To seal her father's eyes up close as oak-
       He thought 'twas witchcraft—but I am much to blame; 1865
       I humbly do beseech you of your pardon
       For too much loving you.

     * Othello. I am bound to thee for ever.

     * Iago. I see this hath a little dash'd your spirits.

     * Othello. Not a jot, not a jot. 1870

     * Iago. I' faith, I fear it has.
       I hope you will consider what is spoke
       Comes from my love. But I do see you're moved:
       I am to pray you not to strain my speech
       To grosser issues nor to larger reach 1875
       Than to suspicion.

     * Othello. I will not.

     * Iago. Should you do so, my lord,
       My speech should fall into such vile success
       As my thoughts aim not at. Cassio's my worthy friend— 1880
       My lord, I see you're moved.

     * Othello. No, not much moved:
       I do not think but Desdemona's honest.

     * Iago. Long live she so! and long live you to think so!

     * Othello. And yet, how nature erring from itself,— 1885

     * Iago. Ay, there's the point: as—to be bold with you—
       Not to affect many proposed matches
       Of her own clime, complexion, and degree,
       Whereto we see in all things nature tends—
       Foh! one may smell in such a will most rank, 1890
       Foul disproportion thoughts unnatural.
       But pardon me; I do not in position
       Distinctly speak of her; though I may fear
       Her will, recoiling to her better judgment,
       May fall to match you with her country forms 1895
       And happily repent.

     * Othello. Farewell, farewell:
       If more thou dost perceive, let me know more;
       Set on thy wife to observe: leave me, Iago:

     * Iago. [Going] My lord, I take my leave. 1900

     * Othello. Why did I marry? This honest creature doubtless
       Sees and knows more, much more, than he unfolds.

     * Iago. [Returning] My lord, I would I might entreat
       your honour
       To scan this thing no further; leave it to time: 1905
       Though it be fit that Cassio have his place,
       For sure, he fills it up with great ability,
       Yet, if you please to hold him off awhile,
       You shall by that perceive him and his means:
       Note, if your lady strain his entertainment 1910
       With any strong or vehement importunity;
       Much will be seen in that. In the mean time,
       Let me be thought too busy in my fears—
       As worthy cause I have to fear I am—
       And hold her free, I do beseech your honour. 1915

     * Othello. Fear not my government.

     * Iago. I once more take my leave.

   [Exit]
     * Othello. This fellow's of exceeding honesty,
       And knows all qualities, with a learned spirit, 1920
       Of human dealings. If I do prove her haggard,
       Though that her jesses were my dear heartstrings,
       I'ld whistle her off and let her down the wind,
       To pray at fortune. Haply, for I am black
       And have not those soft parts of conversation 1925
       That chamberers have, or for I am declined
       Into the vale of years,—yet that's not much—
       She's gone. I am abused; and my relief
       Must be to loathe her. O curse of marriage,
       That we can call these delicate creatures ours, 1930
       And not their appetites! I had rather be a toad,
       And live upon the vapour of a dungeon,
       Than keep a corner in the thing I love
       For others' uses. Yet, 'tis the plague of great ones;
       Prerogatived are they less than the base; 1935
       'Tis destiny unshunnable, like death:
       Even then this forked plague is fated to us
       When we do quicken. Desdemona comes:
       [Re-enter DESDEMONA and EMILIA]
       If she be false, O, then heaven mocks itself! 1940
       I'll not believe't.

     * Desdemona. How now, my dear Othello!
       Your dinner, and the generous islanders
       By you invited, do attend your presence.

     * Othello. I am to blame. 1945

     * Desdemona. Why do you speak so faintly?
       Are you not well?

     * Othello. I have a pain upon my forehead here.

     * Desdemona. 'Faith, that's with watching; 'twill away again:
       Let me but bind it hard, within this hour 1950
       It will be well.

     * Othello. Your napkin is too little:
       [He puts the handkerchief from him; and it drops]
       Let it alone. Come, I'll go in with you.

     * Desdemona. I am very sorry that you are not well. 1955

   [Exeunt OTHELLO and DESDEMONA]
     * Emilia. I am glad I have found this napkin:
       This was her first remembrance from the Moor:
       My wayward husband hath a hundred times
       Woo'd me to steal it; but she so loves the token, 1960
       For he conjured her she should ever keep it,
       That she reserves it evermore about her
       To kiss and talk to. I'll have the work ta'en out,
       And give't Iago: what he will do with it
       Heaven knows, not I; 1965
       I nothing but to please his fantasy.

   [Re-enter Iago]
     * Iago. How now! what do you here alone?

     * Emilia. Do not you chide; I have a thing for you.

     * Iago. A thing for me? it is a common thing— 1970

     * Emilia. Ha!

     * Iago. To have a foolish wife.

     * Emilia. O, is that all? What will you give me now
       For the same handkerchief?

     * Iago. What handkerchief? 1975

     * Emilia. What handkerchief?
       Why, that the Moor first gave to Desdemona;
       That which so often you did bid me steal.

     * Iago. Hast stol'n it from her?

     * Emilia. No, 'faith; she let it drop by negligence. 1980
       And, to the advantage, I, being here, took't up.
       Look, here it is.

     * Iago. A good wench; give it me.

     * Emilia. What will you do with 't, that you have been
       so earnest 1985
       To have me filch it?

     * Iago. [Snatching it] Why, what's that to you?

     * Emilia. If it be not for some purpose of import,
       Give't me again: poor lady, she'll run mad
       When she shall lack it. 1990

     * Iago. Be not acknown on 't; I have use for it.
       Go, leave me.
       [Exit EMILIA]
       I will in Cassio's lodging lose this napkin,
       And let him find it. Trifles light as air 1995
       Are to the jealous confirmations strong
       As proofs of holy writ: this may do something.
       The Moor already changes with my poison:
       Dangerous conceits are, in their natures, poisons.
       Which at the first are scarce found to distaste, 2000
       But with a little act upon the blood.
       Burn like the mines of Sulphur. I did say so:
       Look, where he comes!
       [Re-enter OTHELLO]
       Not poppy, nor mandragora, 2005
       Nor all the drowsy syrups of the world,
       Shall ever medicine thee to that sweet sleep
       Which thou owedst yesterday.

     * Othello. Ha! ha! false to me?

     * Iago. Why, how now, general! no more of that. 2010

     * Othello. Avaunt! be gone! thou hast set me on the rack:
       I swear 'tis better to be much abused
       Than but to know't a little.

     * Iago. How now, my lord!

     * Othello. What sense had I of her stol'n hours of lust? 2015
       I saw't not, thought it not, it harm'd not me:
       I slept the next night well, was free and merry;
       I found not Cassio's kisses on her lips:
       He that is robb'd, not wanting what is stol'n,
       Let him not know't, and he's not robb'd at all. 2020

     * Iago. I am sorry to hear this.

     * Othello. I had been happy, if the general camp,
       Pioners and all, had tasted her sweet body,
       So I had nothing known. O, now, for ever
       Farewell the tranquil mind! farewell content! 2025
       Farewell the plumed troop, and the big wars,
       That make ambition virtue! O, farewell!
       Farewell the neighing steed, and the shrill trump,
       The spirit-stirring drum, the ear-piercing fife,
       The royal banner, and all quality, 2030
       Pride, pomp and circumstance of glorious war!
       And, O you mortal engines, whose rude throats
       The immortal Jove's dead clamours counterfeit,
       Farewell! Othello's occupation's gone!

     * Iago. Is't possible, my lord? 2035

     * Othello. Villain, be sure thou prove my love a whore,
       Be sure of it; give me the ocular proof:
       Or by the worth of man's eternal soul,
       Thou hadst been better have been born a dog
       Than answer my waked wrath! 2040

     * Iago. Is't come to this?

     * Othello. Make me to see't; or, at the least, so prove it,
       That the probation bear no hinge nor loop
       To hang a doubt on; or woe upon thy life!

     * Iago. My noble lord,— 2045

     * Othello. If thou dost slander her and torture me,
       Never pray more; abandon all remorse;
       On horror's head horrors accumulate;
       Do deeds to make heaven weep, all earth amazed;
       For nothing canst thou to damnation add 2050
       Greater than that.

     * Iago. O grace! O heaven forgive me!
       Are you a man? have you a soul or sense?
       God be wi' you; take mine office. O wretched fool.
       That livest to make thine honesty a vice! 2055
       O monstrous world! Take note, take note, O world,
       To be direct and honest is not safe.
       I thank you for this profit; and from hence
       I'll love no friend, sith love breeds such offence.

     * Othello. Nay, stay: thou shouldst be honest. 2060

     * Iago. I should be wise, for honesty's a fool
       And loses that it works for.

     * Othello. By the world,
       I think my wife be honest and think she is not;
       I think that thou art just and think thou art not. 2065
       I'll have some proof. Her name, that was as fresh
       As Dian's visage, is now begrimed and black
       As mine own face. If there be cords, or knives,
       Poison, or fire, or suffocating streams,
       I'll not endure it. Would I were satisfied! 2070

     * Iago. I see, sir, you are eaten up with passion:
       I do repent me that I put it to you.
       You would be satisfied?

     * Othello. Would! nay, I will.

     * Iago. And may: but, how? how satisfied, my lord? 2075
       Would you, the supervisor, grossly gape on—
       Behold her topp'd?

     * Othello. Death and damnation! O!

     * Iago. It were a tedious difficulty, I think,
       To bring them to that prospect: damn them then, 2080
       If ever mortal eyes do see them bolster
       More than their own! What then? how then?
       What shall I say? Where's satisfaction?
       It is impossible you should see this,
       Were they as prime as goats, as hot as monkeys, 2085
       As salt as wolves in pride, and fools as gross
       As ignorance made drunk. But yet, I say,
       If imputation and strong circumstances,
       Which lead directly to the door of truth,
       Will give you satisfaction, you may have't. 2090

     * Othello. Give me a living reason she's disloyal.

     * Iago. I do not like the office:
       But, sith I am enter'd in this cause so far,
       Prick'd to't by foolish honesty and love,
       I will go on. I lay with Cassio lately; 2095
       And, being troubled with a raging tooth,
       I could not sleep.
       There are a kind of men so loose of soul,
       That in their sleeps will mutter their affairs:
       One of this kind is Cassio: 2100
       In sleep I heard him say 'Sweet Desdemona,
       Let us be wary, let us hide our loves;'
       And then, sir, would he gripe and wring my hand,
       Cry 'O sweet creature!' and then kiss me hard,
       As if he pluck'd up kisses by the roots 2105
       That grew upon my lips: then laid his leg
       Over my thigh, and sigh'd, and kiss'd; and then
       Cried 'Cursed fate that gave thee to the Moor!'

     * Othello. O monstrous! monstrous!

     * Iago. Nay, this was but his dream. 2110

     * Othello. But this denoted a foregone conclusion:
       'Tis a shrewd doubt, though it be but a dream.

     * Iago. And this may help to thicken other proofs
       That do demonstrate thinly.

     * Othello. I'll tear her all to pieces. 2115

     * Iago. Nay, but be wise: yet we see nothing done;
       She may be honest yet. Tell me but this,
       Have you not sometimes seen a handkerchief
       Spotted with strawberries in your wife's hand?

     * Othello. I gave her such a one; 'twas my first gift. 2120

     * Iago. I know not that; but such a handkerchief—
       I am sure it was your wife's—did I to-day
       See Cassio wipe his beard with.

     * Othello. If it be that—

     * Iago. If it be that, or any that was hers, 2125
       It speaks against her with the other proofs.

     * Othello. O, that the slave had forty thousand lives!
       One is too poor, too weak for my revenge.
       Now do I see 'tis true. Look here, Iago;
       All my fond love thus do I blow to heaven. 2130
       'Tis gone.
       Arise, black vengeance, from thy hollow cell!
       Yield up, O love, thy crown and hearted throne
       To tyrannous hate! Swell, bosom, with thy fraught,
       For 'tis of aspics' tongues! 2135

     * Iago. Yet be content.

     * Othello. O, blood, blood, blood!

     * Iago. Patience, I say; your mind perhaps may change.

     * Othello. Never, Iago: Like to the Pontic sea,
       Whose icy current and compulsive course 2140
       Ne'er feels retiring ebb, but keeps due on
       To the Propontic and the Hellespont,
       Even so my bloody thoughts, with violent pace,
       Shall ne'er look back, ne'er ebb to humble love,
       Till that a capable and wide revenge 2145
       Swallow them up. Now, by yond marble heaven,
       [Kneels]
       In the due reverence of a sacred vow
       I here engage my words.

     * Iago. Do not rise yet. 2150
       [Kneels]
       Witness, you ever-burning lights above,
       You elements that clip us round about,
       Witness that here Iago doth give up
       The execution of his wit, hands, heart, 2155
       To wrong'd Othello's service! Let him command,
       And to obey shall be in me remorse,
       What bloody business ever.

   [They rise]
     * Othello. I greet thy love, 2160
       Not with vain thanks, but with acceptance bounteous,
       And will upon the instant put thee to't:
       Within these three days let me hear thee say
       That Cassio's not alive.

     * Iago. My friend is dead; 'tis done at your request: 2165
       But let her live.

     * Othello. Damn her, lewd minx! O, damn her!
       Come, go with me apart; I will withdraw,
       To furnish me with some swift means of death
       For the fair devil. Now art thou my lieutenant. 2170

     * Iago. I am your own for ever.

   [Exeunt]

   Act III, Scene 4

   Before the castle.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   [Enter DESDEMONA, EMILIA, and Clown]
     * Desdemona. Do you know, sirrah, where Lieutenant Cassio lies?

     * Clown. I dare not say he lies any where. 2175

     * Desdemona. Why, man?

     * Clown. He's a soldier, and for one to say a soldier lies,
       is stabbing.

     * Desdemona. Go to: where lodges he?

     * Clown. To tell you where he lodges, is to tell you where I lie.
       2180

     * Desdemona. Can any thing be made of this?

     * Clown. I know not where he lodges, and for me to devise a
       lodging and say he lies here or he lies there, were
       to lie in mine own throat.

     * Desdemona. Can you inquire him out, and be edified by report? 2185

     * Clown. I will catechise the world for him; that is, make
       questions, and by them answer.

     * Desdemona. Seek him, bid him come hither: tell him I have
       moved my lord on his behalf, and hope all will be well.

     * Clown. To do this is within the compass of man's wit: and 2190
       therefore I will attempt the doing it.

   [Exit]
     * Desdemona. Where should I lose that handkerchief, Emilia?

     * Emilia. I know not, madam.

     * Desdemona. Believe me, I had rather have lost my purse 2195
       Full of crusadoes: and, but my noble Moor
       Is true of mind and made of no such baseness
       As jealous creatures are, it were enough
       To put him to ill thinking.

     * Emilia. Is he not jealous? 2200

     * Desdemona. Who, he? I think the sun where he was born
       Drew all such humours from him.

     * Emilia. Look, where he comes.

     * Desdemona. I will not leave him now till Cassio
       Be call'd to him. 2205
       [Enter OTHELLO]
       How is't with you, my lord

     * Othello. Well, my good lady.
       [Aside]
       O, hardness to dissemble!— 2210
       How do you, Desdemona?

     * Desdemona. Well, my good lord.

     * Othello. Give me your hand: this hand is moist, my lady.

     * Desdemona. It yet hath felt no age nor known no sorrow.

     * Othello. This argues fruitfulness and liberal heart: 2215
       Hot, hot, and moist: this hand of yours requires
       A sequester from liberty, fasting and prayer,
       Much castigation, exercise devout;
       For here's a young and sweating devil here,
       That commonly rebels. 'Tis a good hand, 2220
       A frank one.

     * Desdemona. You may, indeed, say so;
       For 'twas that hand that gave away my heart.

     * Othello. A liberal hand: the hearts of old gave hands;
       But our new heraldry is hands, not hearts. 2225

     * Desdemona. I cannot speak of this. Come now, your promise.

     * Othello. What promise, chuck?

     * Desdemona. I have sent to bid Cassio come speak with you.

     * Othello. I have a salt and sorry rheum offends me;
       Lend me thy handkerchief. 2230

     * Desdemona. Here, my lord.

     * Othello. That which I gave you.

     * Desdemona. I have it not about me.

     * Othello. Not?

     * Desdemona. No, indeed, my lord. 2235

     * Othello. That is a fault.
       That handkerchief
       Did an Egyptian to my mother give;
       She was a charmer, and could almost read
       The thoughts of people: she told her, while 2240
       she kept it,
       'Twould make her amiable and subdue my father
       Entirely to her love, but if she lost it
       Or made gift of it, my father's eye
       Should hold her loathed and his spirits should hunt 2245
       After new fancies: she, dying, gave it me;
       And bid me, when my fate would have me wive,
       To give it her. I did so: and take heed on't;
       Make it a darling like your precious eye;
       To lose't or give't away were such perdition 2250
       As nothing else could match.

     * Desdemona. Is't possible?

     * Othello. 'Tis true: there's magic in the web of it:
       A sibyl, that had number'd in the world
       The sun to course two hundred compasses, 2255
       In her prophetic fury sew'd the work;
       The worms were hallow'd that did breed the silk;
       And it was dyed in mummy which the skilful
       Conserved of maidens' hearts.

     * Desdemona. Indeed! is't true? 2260

     * Othello. Most veritable; therefore look to't well.

     * Desdemona. Then would to God that I had never seen't!

     * Othello. Ha! wherefore?

     * Desdemona. Why do you speak so startingly and rash?

     * Othello. Is't lost? is't gone? speak, is it out 2265
       o' the way?

     * Desdemona. Heaven bless us!

     * Othello. Say you?

     * Desdemona. It is not lost; but what an if it were?

     * Othello. How! 2270

     * Desdemona. I say, it is not lost.

     * Othello. Fetch't, let me see't.

     * Desdemona. Why, so I can, sir, but I will not now.
       This is a trick to put me from my suit:
       Pray you, let Cassio be received again. 2275

     * Othello. Fetch me the handkerchief: my mind misgives.

     * Desdemona. Come, come;
       You'll never meet a more sufficient man.

     * Othello. The handkerchief!

     * Desdemona. I pray, talk me of Cassio. 2280

     * Othello. The handkerchief!

     * Desdemona. A man that all his time
       Hath founded his good fortunes on your love,
       Shared dangers with you,—

     * Othello. The handkerchief! 2285

     * Desdemona. In sooth, you are to blame.

     * Othello. Away!

   [Exit]
     * Emilia. Is not this man jealous?

     * Desdemona. I ne'er saw this before. 2290
       Sure, there's some wonder in this handkerchief:
       I am most unhappy in the loss of it.

     * Emilia. 'Tis not a year or two shows us a man:
       They are all but stomachs, and we all but food;
       To eat us hungerly, and when they are full, 2295
       They belch us. Look you, Cassio and my husband!

   [Enter CASSIO and IAGO]
     * Iago. There is no other way; 'tis she must do't:
       And, lo, the happiness! go, and importune her.

     * Desdemona. How now, good Cassio! what's the news with you? 2300

     * Cassio. Madam, my former suit: I do beseech you
       That by your virtuous means I may again
       Exist, and be a member of his love
       Whom I with all the office of my heart
       Entirely honour: I would not be delay'd. 2305
       If my offence be of such mortal kind
       That nor my service past, nor present sorrows,
       Nor purposed merit in futurity,
       Can ransom me into his love again,
       But to know so must be my benefit; 2310
       So shall I clothe me in a forced content,
       And shut myself up in some other course,
       To fortune's alms.

     * Desdemona. Alas, thrice-gentle Cassio!
       My advocation is not now in tune; 2315
       My lord is not my lord; nor should I know him,
       Were he in favour as in humour alter'd.
       So help me every spirit sanctified,
       As I have spoken for you all my best
       And stood within the blank of his displeasure 2320
       For my free speech! you must awhile be patient:
       What I can do I will; and more I will
       Than for myself I dare: let that suffice you.

     * Iago. Is my lord angry?

     * Emilia. He went hence but now, 2325
       And certainly in strange unquietness.

     * Iago. Can he be angry? I have seen the cannon,
       When it hath blown his ranks into the air,
       And, like the devil, from his very arm
       Puff'd his own brother:—and can he be angry? 2330
       Something of moment then: I will go meet him:
       There's matter in't indeed, if he be angry.

     * Desdemona. I prithee, do so.
       [Exit IAGO]
       Something, sure, of state, 2335
       Either from Venice, or some unhatch'd practise
       Made demonstrable here in Cyprus to him,
       Hath puddled his clear spirit: and in such cases
       Men's natures wrangle with inferior things,
       Though great ones are their object. 'Tis even so; 2340
       For let our finger ache, and it indues
       Our other healthful members even to that sense
       Of pain: nay, we must think men are not gods,
       Nor of them look for such observances
       As fit the bridal. Beshrew me much, Emilia, 2345
       I was, unhandsome warrior as I am,
       Arraigning his unkindness with my soul;
       But now I find I had suborn'd the witness,
       And he's indicted falsely.

     * Emilia. Pray heaven it be state-matters, as you think, 2350
       And no conception nor no jealous toy
       Concerning you.

     * Desdemona. Alas the day! I never gave him cause.

     * Emilia. But jealous souls will not be answer'd so;
       They are not ever jealous for the cause, 2355
       But jealous for they are jealous: 'tis a monster
       Begot upon itself, born on itself.

     * Desdemona. Heaven keep that monster from Othello's mind!

     * Emilia. Lady, amen.

     * Desdemona. I will go seek him. Cassio, walk hereabout: 2360
       If I do find him fit, I'll move your suit
       And seek to effect it to my uttermost.

     * Cassio. I humbly thank your ladyship.

   [Exeunt DESDEMONA and EMILIA]

   [Enter BIANCA]
     * Bianca. Save you, friend Cassio!

     * Cassio. What make you from home?
       How is it with you, my most fair Bianca?
       I' faith, sweet love, I was coming to your house.

     * Bianca. And I was going to your lodging, Cassio. 2370
       What, keep a week away? seven days and nights?
       Eight score eight hours? and lovers' absent hours,
       More tedious than the dial eight score times?
       O weary reckoning!

     * Cassio. Pardon me, Bianca: 2375
       I have this while with leaden thoughts been press'd:
       But I shall, in a more continuate time,
       Strike off this score of absence. Sweet Bianca,
       [Giving her DESDEMONA's handkerchief]
       Take me this work out. 2380

     * Bianca. O Cassio, whence came this?
       This is some token from a newer friend:
       To the felt absence now I feel a cause:
       Is't come to this? Well, well.

     * Cassio. Go to, woman! 2385
       Throw your vile guesses in the devil's teeth,
       From whence you have them. You are jealous now
       That this is from some mistress, some remembrance:
       No, in good troth, Bianca.

     * Bianca. Why, whose is it? 2390

     * Cassio. I know not, sweet: I found it in my chamber.
       I like the work well: ere it be demanded—
       As like enough it will—I'ld have it copied:
       Take it, and do't; and leave me for this time.

     * Bianca. Leave you! wherefore? 2395

     * Cassio. I do attend here on the general;
       And think it no addition, nor my wish,
       To have him see me woman'd.

     * Bianca. Why, I pray you?

     * Cassio. Not that I love you not. 2400

     * Bianca. But that you do not love me.
       I pray you, bring me on the way a little,
       And say if I shall see you soon at night.

     * Cassio. 'Tis but a little way that I can bring you;
       For I attend here: but I'll see you soon. 2405

     * Bianca. 'Tis very good; I must be circumstanced.

   [Exeunt]

   Act IV, Scene 1

   Cyprus. Before the castle.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   [Enter OTHELLO and IAGO]
     * Iago. Will you think so?

     * Othello. Think so, Iago! 2410

     * Iago. What,
       To kiss in private?

     * Othello. An unauthorized kiss.

     * Iago. Or to be naked with her friend in bed
       An hour or more, not meaning any harm? 2415

     * Othello. Naked in bed, Iago, and not mean harm!
       It is hypocrisy against the devil:
       They that mean virtuously, and yet do so,
       The devil their virtue tempts, and they tempt heaven.

     * Iago. So they do nothing, 'tis a venial slip: 2420
       But if I give my wife a handkerchief,—

     * Othello. What then?

     * Iago. Why, then, 'tis hers, my lord; and, being hers,
       She may, I think, bestow't on any man.

     * Othello. She is protectress of her honour too: 2425
       May she give that?

     * Iago. Her honour is an essence that's not seen;
       They have it very oft that have it not:
       But, for the handkerchief,—

     * Othello. By heaven, I would most gladly have forgot it. 2430
       Thou said'st, it comes o'er my memory,
       As doth the raven o'er the infected house,
       Boding to all—he had my handkerchief.

     * Iago. Ay, what of that?

     * Othello. That's not so good now. 2435

     * Iago. What,
       If I had said I had seen him do you wrong?
       Or heard him say,—as knaves be such abroad,
       Who having, by their own importunate suit,
       Or voluntary dotage of some mistress, 2440
       Convinced or supplied them, cannot choose
       But they must blab—

     * Othello. Hath he said any thing?

     * Iago. He hath, my lord; but be you well assured,
       No more than he'll unswear. 2445

     * Othello. What hath he said?

     * Iago. 'Faith, that he did—I know not what he did.

     * Othello. What? what?

     * Iago. Lie—

     * Othello. With her? 2450

     * Iago. With her, on her; what you will.

     * Othello. Lie with her! lie on her! We say lie on her, when
       they belie her. Lie with her! that's fulsome.
       —Handkerchief—confessions—handkerchief!—To
       confess, and be hanged for his labour;—first, to be 2455
       hanged, and then to confess.—I tremble at it.
       Nature would not invest herself in such shadowing
       passion without some instruction. It is not words
       that shake me thus. Pish! Noses, ears, and lips.
       —Is't possible?—Confess—handkerchief!—O devil!— 2460

   [Falls in a trance]
     * Iago. Work on,
       My medicine, work! Thus credulous fools are caught;
       And many worthy and chaste dames even thus,
       All guiltless, meet reproach. What, ho! my lord! 2465
       My lord, I say! Othello!
       [Enter CASSIO]
       How now, Cassio!

     * Cassio. What's the matter?

     * Iago. My lord is fall'n into an epilepsy: 2470
       This is his second fit; he had one yesterday.

     * Cassio. Rub him about the temples.

     * Iago. No, forbear;
       The lethargy must have his quiet course:
       If not, he foams at mouth and by and by 2475
       Breaks out to savage madness. Look he stirs:
       Do you withdraw yourself a little while,
       He will recover straight: when he is gone,
       I would on great occasion speak with you.
       [Exit CASSIO] 2480
       How is it, general? have you not hurt your head?

     * Othello. Dost thou mock me?

     * Iago. I mock you! no, by heaven.
       Would you would bear your fortune like a man!

     * Othello. A horned man's a monster and a beast. 2485

     * Iago. There's many a beast then in a populous city,
       And many a civil monster.

     * Othello. Did he confess it?

     * Iago. Good sir, be a man;
       Think every bearded fellow that's but yoked 2490
       May draw with you: there's millions now alive
       That nightly lie in those unproper beds
       Which they dare swear peculiar: your case is better.
       O, 'tis the spite of hell, the fiend's arch-mock,
       To lip a wanton in a secure couch, 2495
       And to suppose her chaste! No, let me know;
       And knowing what I am, I know what she shall be.

     * Othello. O, thou art wise; 'tis certain.

     * Iago. Stand you awhile apart;
       Confine yourself but in a patient list. 2500
       Whilst you were here o'erwhelmed with your grief—
       A passion most unsuiting such a man—
       Cassio came hither: I shifted him away,
       And laid good 'scuse upon your ecstasy,
       Bade him anon return and here speak with me; 2505
       The which he promised. Do but encave yourself,
       And mark the fleers, the gibes, and notable scorns,
       That dwell in every region of his face;
       For I will make him tell the tale anew,
       Where, how, how oft, how long ago, and when 2510
       He hath, and is again to cope your wife:
       I say, but mark his gesture. Marry, patience;
       Or I shall say you are all in all in spleen,
       And nothing of a man.

     * Othello. Dost thou hear, Iago? 2515
       I will be found most cunning in my patience;
       But—dost thou hear?—most bloody.

     * Iago. That's not amiss;
       But yet keep time in all. Will you withdraw?
       [OTHELLO retires] 2520
       Now will I question Cassio of Bianca,
       A housewife that by selling her desires
       Buys herself bread and clothes: it is a creature
       That dotes on Cassio; as 'tis the strumpet's plague
       To beguile many and be beguiled by one: 2525
       He, when he hears of her, cannot refrain
       From the excess of laughter. Here he comes:
       [Re-enter CASSIO]
       As he shall smile, Othello shall go mad;
       And his unbookish jealousy must construe 2530
       Poor Cassio's smiles, gestures and light behavior,
       Quite in the wrong. How do you now, lieutenant?

     * Cassio. The worser that you give me the addition
       Whose want even kills me.

     * Iago. Ply Desdemona well, and you are sure on't. 2535
       [Speaking lower]
       Now, if this suit lay in Bianco's power,
       How quickly should you speed!

     * Cassio. Alas, poor caitiff!

     * Othello. Look, how he laughs already! 2540

     * Iago. I never knew woman love man so.

     * Cassio. Alas, poor rogue! I think, i' faith, she loves me.

     * Othello. Now he denies it faintly, and laughs it out.

     * Iago. Do you hear, Cassio?

     * Othello. Now he importunes him 2545
       To tell it o'er: go to; well said, well said.

     * Iago. She gives it out that you shall marry hey:
       Do you intend it?

     * Cassio. Ha, ha, ha!

     * Othello. Do you triumph, Roman? do you triumph? 2550

     * Cassio. I marry her! what? a customer! Prithee, bear some
       charity to my wit: do not think it so unwholesome.
       Ha, ha, ha!

     * Othello. So, so, so, so: they laugh that win.

     * Iago. 'Faith, the cry goes that you shall marry her. 2555

     * Cassio. Prithee, say true.

     * Iago. I am a very villain else.

     * Othello. Have you scored me? Well.

     * Cassio. This is the monkey's own giving out: she is
       persuaded I will marry her, out of her own love and 2560
       flattery, not out of my promise.

     * Othello. Iago beckons me; now he begins the story.

     * Cassio. She was here even now; she haunts me in every place.
       I was the other day talking on the sea-bank with
       certain Venetians; and thither comes the bauble, 2565
       and, by this hand, she falls me thus about my neck—

     * Othello. Crying 'O dear Cassio!' as it were: his gesture
       imports it.

     * Cassio. So hangs, and lolls, and weeps upon me; so hales,
       and pulls me: ha, ha, ha! 2570

     * Othello. Now he tells how she plucked him to my chamber. O,
       I see that nose of yours, but not that dog I shall
       throw it to.

     * Cassio. Well, I must leave her company.

     * Iago. Before me! look, where she comes. 2575

     * Cassio. 'Tis such another fitchew! marry a perfumed one.
       [Enter BIANCA]
       What do you mean by this haunting of me?

     * Bianca. Let the devil and his dam haunt you! What did you
       mean by that same handkerchief you gave me even now? 2580
       I was a fine fool to take it. I must take out the
       work?—A likely piece of work, that you should find
       it in your chamber, and not know who left it there!
       This is some minx's token, and I must take out the
       work? There; give it your hobby-horse: wheresoever 2585
       you had it, I'll take out no work on't.

     * Cassio. How now, my sweet Bianca! how now! how now!

     * Othello. By heaven, that should be my handkerchief!

     * Bianca. An you'll come to supper to-night, you may; an you
       will not, come when you are next prepared for. 2590

   [Exit]
     * Iago. After her, after her.

     * Cassio. 'Faith, I must; she'll rail in the street else.

     * Iago. Will you sup there?

     * Cassio. 'Faith, I intend so. 2595

     * Iago. Well, I may chance to see you; for I would very fain
       speak with you.

     * Cassio. Prithee, come; will you?

     * Iago. Go to; say no more.

   [Exit CASSIO]
     * Othello. [Advancing] How shall I murder him, Iago?

     * Iago. Did you perceive how he laughed at his vice?

     * Othello. O Iago!

     * Iago. And did you see the handkerchief?

     * Othello. Was that mine? 2605

     * Iago. Yours by this hand: and to see how he prizes the
       foolish woman your wife! she gave it him, and he
       hath given it his whore.

     * Othello. I would have him nine years a-killing.
       A fine woman! a fair woman! a sweet woman! 2610

     * Iago. Nay, you must forget that.

     * Othello. Ay, let her rot, and perish, and be damned to-night;
       for she shall not live: no, my heart is turned to
       stone; I strike it, and it hurts my hand. O, the
       world hath not a sweeter creature: she might lie by 2615
       an emperor's side and command him tasks.

     * Iago. Nay, that's not your way.

     * Othello. Hang her! I do but say what she is: so delicate
       with her needle: an admirable musician: O! she
       will sing the savageness out of a bear: of so high 2620
       and plenteous wit and invention:—

     * Iago. She's the worse for all this.

     * Othello. O, a thousand thousand times: and then, of so
       gentle a condition!

     * Iago. Ay, too gentle. 2625

     * Othello. Nay, that's certain: but yet the pity of it, Iago!
       O Iago, the pity of it, Iago!

     * Iago. If you are so fond over her iniquity, give her
       patent to offend; for, if it touch not you, it comes
       near nobody. 2630

     * Othello. I will chop her into messes: cuckold me!

     * Iago. O, 'tis foul in her.

     * Othello. With mine officer!

     * Iago. That's fouler.

     * Othello. Get me some poison, Iago; this night: I'll not 2635
       expostulate with her, lest her body and beauty
       unprovide my mind again: this night, Iago.

     * Iago. Do it not with poison, strangle her in her bed, even
       the bed she hath contaminated.

     * Othello. Good, good: the justice of it pleases: very good. 2640

     * Iago. And for Cassio, let me be his undertaker: you
       shall hear more by midnight.

     * Othello. Excellent good.
       [A trumpet within]
       What trumpet is that same? 2645

     * Iago. Something from Venice, sure. 'Tis Lodovico
       Come from the duke: and, see, your wife is with him.

   [Enter LODOVICO, DESDEMONA, and Attendants]
     * Lodovico. Save you, worthy general!

     * Othello. With all my heart, sir. 2650

     * Lodovico. The duke and senators of Venice greet you.

   [Gives him a letter]
     * Othello. I kiss the instrument of their pleasures.

   [Opens the letter, and reads]
     * Desdemona. And what's the news, good cousin Lodovico? 2655

     * Iago. I am very glad to see you, signior
       Welcome to Cyprus.

     * Lodovico. I thank you. How does Lieutenant Cassio?

     * Iago. Lives, sir.

     * Desdemona. Cousin, there's fall'n between him and my lord 2660
       An unkind breach: but you shall make all well.

     * Othello. Are you sure of that?

     * Desdemona. My lord?

     * Othello. [Reads] 'This fail you not to do, as you will—'

     * Lodovico. He did not call; he's busy in the paper. 2665
       Is there division 'twixt my lord and Cassio?

     * Desdemona. A most unhappy one: I would do much
       To atone them, for the love I bear to Cassio.

     * Othello. Fire and brimstone!

     * Desdemona. My lord? 2670

     * Othello. Are you wise?

     * Desdemona. What, is he angry?

     * Lodovico. May be the letter moved him;
       For, as I think, they do command him home,
       Deputing Cassio in his government. 2675

     * Desdemona. Trust me, I am glad on't.

     * Othello. Indeed!

     * Desdemona. My lord?

     * Othello. I am glad to see you mad.

     * Desdemona. Why, sweet Othello,— 2680

     * Othello. [Striking her] Devil!

     * Desdemona. I have not deserved this.

     * Lodovico. My lord, this would not be believed in Venice,
       Though I should swear I saw't: 'tis very much:
       Make her amends; she weeps. 2685

     * Othello. O devil, devil!
       If that the earth could teem with woman's tears,
       Each drop she falls would prove a crocodile.
       Out of my sight!

     * Desdemona. I will not stay to offend you. 2690

   [Going]
     * Lodovico. Truly, an obedient lady:
       I do beseech your lordship, call her back.

     * Othello. Mistress!

     * Desdemona. My lord? 2695

     * Othello. What would you with her, sir?

     * Lodovico. Who, I, my lord?

     * Othello. Ay; you did wish that I would make her turn:
       Sir, she can turn, and turn, and yet go on,
       And turn again; and she can weep, sir, weep; 2700
       And she's obedient, as you say, obedient,
       Very obedient. Proceed you in your tears.
       Concerning this, sir,—O well-painted passion!—
       I am commanded home. Get you away;
       I'll send for you anon. Sir, I obey the mandate, 2705
       And will return to Venice. Hence, avaunt!
       [Exit DESDEMONA]
       Cassio shall have my place. And, sir, tonight,
       I do entreat that we may sup together:
       You are welcome, sir, to Cyprus.—Goats and monkeys! 2710

   [Exit]
     * Lodovico. Is this the noble Moor whom our full senate
       Call all in all sufficient? Is this the nature
       Whom passion could not shake? whose solid virtue
       The shot of accident, nor dart of chance, 2715
       Could neither graze nor pierce?

     * Iago. He is much changed.

     * Lodovico. Are his wits safe? is he not light of brain?

     * Iago. He's that he is: I may not breathe my censure
       What he might be: if what he might he is not, 2720
       I would to heaven he were!

     * Lodovico. What, strike his wife!

     * Iago. 'Faith, that was not so well; yet would I knew
       That stroke would prove the worst!

     * Lodovico. Is it his use? 2725
       Or did the letters work upon his blood,
       And new-create this fault?

     * Iago. Alas, alas!
       It is not honesty in me to speak
       What I have seen and known. You shall observe him, 2730
       And his own courses will denote him so
       That I may save my speech: do but go after,
       And mark how he continues.

     * Lodovico. I am sorry that I am deceived in him.

   [Exeunt]

   Act IV, Scene 2

   A room in the castle.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   [Enter OTHELLO and EMILIA]
     * Othello. You have seen nothing then?

     * Emilia. Nor ever heard, nor ever did suspect.

     * Othello. Yes, you have seen Cassio and she together.

     * Emilia. But then I saw no harm, and then I heard 2740
       Each syllable that breath made up between them.

     * Othello. What, did they never whisper?

     * Emilia. Never, my lord.

     * Othello. Nor send you out o' the way?

     * Emilia. Never. 2745

     * Othello. To fetch her fan, her gloves, her mask, nor nothing?

     * Emilia. Never, my lord.

     * Othello. That's strange.

     * Emilia. I durst, my lord, to wager she is honest,
       Lay down my soul at stake: if you think other, 2750
       Remove your thought; it doth abuse your bosom.
       If any wretch have put this in your head,
       Let heaven requite it with the serpent's curse!
       For, if she be not honest, chaste, and true,
       There's no man happy; the purest of their wives 2755
       Is foul as slander.

     * Othello. Bid her come hither: go.
       [Exit EMILIA]
       She says enough; yet she's a simple bawd
       That cannot say as much. This is a subtle whore, 2760
       A closet lock and key of villanous secrets
       And yet she'll kneel and pray; I have seen her do't.

   [Enter DESDEMONA with EMILIA]
     * Desdemona. My lord, what is your will?

     * Othello. Pray, chuck, come hither. 2765

     * Desdemona. What is your pleasure?

     * Othello. Let me see your eyes;
       Look in my face.

     * Desdemona. What horrible fancy's this?

     * Othello. [To EMILIA] Some of your function, mistress; 2770
       Leave procreants alone and shut the door;
       Cough, or cry 'hem,' if any body come:
       Your mystery, your mystery: nay, dispatch.

   [Exit EMILIA]
     * Desdemona. Upon my knees, what doth your speech import? 2775
       I understand a fury in your words.
       But not the words.

     * Othello. Why, what art thou?

     * Desdemona. Your wife, my lord; your true
       And loyal wife. 2780

     * Othello. Come, swear it, damn thyself
       Lest, being like one of heaven, the devils themselves
       Should fear to seize thee: therefore be double damn'd:
       Swear thou art honest.

     * Desdemona. Heaven doth truly know it. 2785

     * Othello. Heaven truly knows that thou art false as hell.

     * Desdemona. To whom, my lord? with whom? how am I false?

     * Othello. O Desdemona! away! away! away!

     * Desdemona. Alas the heavy day! Why do you weep?
       Am I the motive of these tears, my lord? 2790
       If haply you my father do suspect
       An instrument of this your calling back,
       Lay not your blame on me: If you have lost him,
       Why, I have lost him too.

     * Othello. Had it pleased heaven 2795
       To try me with affliction; had they rain'd
       All kinds of sores and shames on my bare head.
       Steep'd me in poverty to the very lips,
       Given to captivity me and my utmost hopes,
       I should have found in some place of my soul 2800
       A drop of patience: but, alas, to make me
       A fixed figure for the time of scorn
       To point his slow unmoving finger at!
       Yet could I bear that too; well, very well:
       But there, where I have garner'd up my heart, 2805
       Where either I must live, or bear no life;
       The fountain from the which my current runs,
       Or else dries up; to be discarded thence!
       Or keep it as a cistern for foul toads
       To knot and gender in! Turn thy complexion there, 2810
       Patience, thou young and rose-lipp'd cherubin,—
       Ay, there, look grim as hell!

     * Desdemona. I hope my noble lord esteems me honest.

     * Othello. O, ay; as summer flies are in the shambles,
       That quicken even with blowing. O thou weed, 2815
       Who art so lovely fair and smell'st so sweet
       That the sense aches at thee, would thou hadst
       ne'er been born!

     * Desdemona. Alas, what ignorant sin have I committed?

     * Othello. Was this fair paper, this most goodly book, 2820
       Made to write 'whore' upon? What committed!
       Committed! O thou public commoner!
       I should make very forges of my cheeks,
       That would to cinders burn up modesty,
       Did I but speak thy deeds. What committed! 2825
       Heaven stops the nose at it and the moon winks,
       The bawdy wind that kisses all it meets
       Is hush'd within the hollow mine of earth,
       And will not hear it. What committed!
       Impudent strumpet! 2830

     * Desdemona. By heaven, you do me wrong.

     * Othello. Are you not a strumpet?

     * Desdemona. No, as I am a Christian:
       If to preserve this vessel for my lord
       From any other foul unlawful touch 2835
       Be not to be a strumpet, I am none.

     * Othello. What, not a whore?

     * Desdemona. No, as I shall be saved.

     * Othello. Is't possible?

     * Desdemona. O, heaven forgive us! 2840

     * Othello. I cry you mercy, then:
       I took you for that cunning whore of Venice
       That married with Othello.
       [Raising his voice]
       You, mistress, 2845
       That have the office opposite to Saint Peter,
       And keep the gate of hell!
       [Re-enter EMILIA]
       You, you, ay, you!
       We have done our course; there's money for your pains: 2850
       I pray you, turn the key and keep our counsel.

   [Exit]
     * Emilia. Alas, what does this gentleman conceive?
       How do you, madam? how do you, my good lady?

     * Desdemona. 'Faith, half asleep. 2855

     * Emilia. Good madam, what's the matter with my lord?

     * Desdemona. With who?

     * Emilia. Why, with my lord, madam.

     * Desdemona. Who is thy lord?

     * Emilia. He that is yours, sweet lady. 2860

     * Desdemona. I have none: do not talk to me, Emilia;
       I cannot weep; nor answer have I none,
       But what should go by water. Prithee, tonight
       Lay on my bed my wedding sheets: remember;
       And call thy husband hither. 2865

     * Emilia. Here's a change indeed!

   [Exit]
     * Desdemona. 'Tis meet I should be used so, very meet.
       How have I been behaved, that he might stick
       The small'st opinion on my least misuse? 2870

   [Re-enter EMILIA with IAGO]
     * Iago. What is your pleasure, madam?
       How is't with you?

     * Desdemona. I cannot tell. Those that do teach young babes
       Do it with gentle means and easy tasks: 2875
       He might have chid me so; for, in good faith,
       I am a child to chiding.

     * Iago. What's the matter, lady?

     * Emilia. Alas, Iago, my lord hath so bewhored her.
       Thrown such despite and heavy terms upon her, 2880
       As true hearts cannot bear.

     * Desdemona. Am I that name, Iago?

     * Iago. What name, fair lady?

     * Desdemona. Such as she says my lord did say I was.

     * Emilia. He call'd her whore: a beggar in his drink 2885
       Could not have laid such terms upon his callat.

     * Iago. Why did he so?

     * Desdemona. I do not know; I am sure I am none such.

     * Iago. Do not weep, do not weep. Alas the day!

     * Emilia. Hath she forsook so many noble matches, 2890
       Her father and her country and her friends,
       To be call'd whore? would it not make one weep?

     * Desdemona. It is my wretched fortune.

     * Iago. Beshrew him for't!
       How comes this trick upon him? 2895

     * Desdemona. Nay, heaven doth know.

     * Emilia. I will be hang'd, if some eternal villain,
       Some busy and insinuating rogue,
       Some cogging, cozening slave, to get some office,
       Have not devised this slander; I'll be hang'd else. 2900

     * Iago. Fie, there is no such man; it is impossible.

     * Desdemona. If any such there be, heaven pardon him!

     * Emilia. A halter pardon him! and hell gnaw his bones!
       Why should he call her whore? who keeps her company?
       What place? what time? what form? what likelihood? 2905
       The Moor's abused by some most villanous knave,
       Some base notorious knave, some scurvy fellow.
       O heaven, that such companions thou'ldst unfold,
       And put in every honest hand a whip
       To lash the rascals naked through the world 2910
       Even from the east to the west!

     * Iago. Speak within door.

     * Emilia. O, fie upon them! Some such squire he was
       That turn'd your wit the seamy side without,
       And made you to suspect me with the Moor. 2915

     * Iago. You are a fool; go to.

     * Desdemona. O good Iago,
       What shall I do to win my lord again?
       Good friend, go to him; for, by this light of heaven,
       I know not how I lost him. Here I kneel: 2920
       If e'er my will did trespass 'gainst his love,
       Either in discourse of thought or actual deed,
       Or that mine eyes, mine ears, or any sense,
       Delighted them in any other form;
       Or that I do not yet, and ever did. 2925
       And ever will—though he do shake me off
       To beggarly divorcement—love him dearly,
       Comfort forswear me! Unkindness may do much;
       And his unkindness may defeat my life,
       But never taint my love. I cannot say 'whore:' 2930
       It does abhor me now I speak the word;
       To do the act that might the addition earn
       Not the world's mass of vanity could make me.

     * Iago. I pray you, be content; 'tis but his humour:
       The business of the state does him offence, 2935
       And he does chide with you.

     * Desdemona. If 'twere no other—

     * Iago. 'Tis but so, I warrant.
       [Trumpets within]
       Hark, how these instruments summon to supper! 2940
       The messengers of Venice stay the meat;
       Go in, and weep not; all things shall be well.
       [Exeunt DESDEMONA and EMILIA]
       [Enter RODERIGO]
       How now, Roderigo! 2945

     * Roderigo. I do not find that thou dealest justly with me.

     * Iago. What in the contrary?

     * Roderigo. Every day thou daffest me with some device, Iago;
       and rather, as it seems to me now, keepest from me
       all conveniency than suppliest me with the least 2950
       advantage of hope. I will indeed no longer endure
       it, nor am I yet persuaded to put up in peace what
       already I have foolishly suffered.

     * Iago. Will you hear me, Roderigo?

     * Roderigo. 'Faith, I have heard too much, for your words and 2955
       performances are no kin together.

     * Iago. You charge me most unjustly.

     * Roderigo. With nought but truth. I have wasted myself out of
       my means. The jewels you have had from me to
       deliver to Desdemona would half have corrupted a 2960
       votarist: you have told me she hath received them
       and returned me expectations and comforts of sudden
       respect and acquaintance, but I find none.

     * Iago. Well; go to; very well.

     * Roderigo. Very well! go to! I cannot go to, man; nor 'tis 2965
       not very well: nay, I think it is scurvy, and begin
       to find myself fobbed in it.

     * Iago. Very well.

     * Roderigo. I tell you 'tis not very well. I will make myself
       known to Desdemona: if she will return me my 2970
       jewels, I will give over my suit and repent my
       unlawful solicitation; if not, assure yourself I
       will seek satisfaction of you.

     * Iago. You have said now.

     * Roderigo. Ay, and said nothing but what I protest intendment of
       doing. 2975

     * Iago. Why, now I see there's mettle in thee, and even from
       this instant to build on thee a better opinion than
       ever before. Give me thy hand, Roderigo: thou hast
       taken against me a most just exception; but yet, I
       protest, I have dealt most directly in thy affair. 2980

     * Roderigo. It hath not appeared.

     * Iago. I grant indeed it hath not appeared, and your
       suspicion is not without wit and judgment. But,
       Roderigo, if thou hast that in thee indeed, which I
       have greater reason to believe now than ever, I mean 2985
       purpose, courage and valour, this night show it: if
       thou the next night following enjoy not Desdemona,
       take me from this world with treachery and devise
       engines for my life.

     * Roderigo. Well, what is it? is it within reason and compass? 2990

     * Iago. Sir, there is especial commission come from Venice
       to depute Cassio in Othello's place.

     * Roderigo. Is that true? why, then Othello and Desdemona
       return again to Venice.

     * Iago. O, no; he goes into Mauritania and takes away with 2995
       him the fair Desdemona, unless his abode be
       lingered here by some accident: wherein none can be
       so determinate as the removing of Cassio.

     * Roderigo. How do you mean, removing of him?

     * Iago. Why, by making him uncapable of Othello's place; 3000
       knocking out his brains.

     * Roderigo. And that you would have me to do?

     * Iago. Ay, if you dare do yourself a profit and a right.
       He sups to-night with a harlotry, and thither will I
       go to him: he knows not yet of his horrorable 3005
       fortune. If you will watch his going thence, which
       I will fashion to fall out between twelve and one,
       you may take him at your pleasure: I will be near
       to second your attempt, and he shall fall between
       us. Come, stand not amazed at it, but go along with 3010
       me; I will show you such a necessity in his death
       that you shall think yourself bound to put it on
       him. It is now high suppertime, and the night grows
       to waste: about it.

     * Roderigo. I will hear further reason for this. 3015

     * Iago. And you shall be satisfied.

   [Exeunt]

   Act IV, Scene 3

   Another room in the castle.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   [Enter OTHELLO, LODOVICO, DESDEMONA, EMILIA and Attendants]
     * Lodovico. I do beseech you, sir, trouble yourself no further.

     * Othello. O, pardon me: 'twill do me good to walk. 3020

     * Lodovico. Madam, good night; I humbly thank your ladyship.

     * Desdemona. Your honour is most welcome.

     * Othello. Will you walk, sir?
       O,—Desdemona,—

     * Desdemona. My lord? 3025

     * Othello. Get you to bed on the instant; I will be returned
       forthwith: dismiss your attendant there: look it be done.

     * Desdemona. I will, my lord.

   [Exeunt OTHELLO, LODOVICO, and Attendants]
     * Emilia. How goes it now? he looks gentler than he did. 3030

     * Desdemona. He says he will return incontinent:
       He hath commanded me to go to bed,
       And bade me to dismiss you.

     * Emilia. Dismiss me!

     * Desdemona. It was his bidding: therefore, good Emilia,. 3035
       Give me my nightly wearing, and adieu:
       We must not now displease him.

     * Emilia. I would you had never seen him!

     * Desdemona. So would not I. my love doth so approve him,
       That even his stubbornness, his cheques, his frowns— 3040
       Prithee, unpin me,—have grace and favour in them.

     * Emilia. I have laid those sheets you bade me on the bed.

     * Desdemona. All's one. Good faith, how foolish are our minds!
       If I do die before thee prithee, shroud me
       In one of those same sheets. 3045

     * Emilia. Come, come you talk.

     * Desdemona. My mother had a maid call'd Barbara:
       She was in love, and he she loved proved mad
       And did forsake her: she had a song of 'willow;'
       An old thing 'twas, but it express'd her fortune, 3050
       And she died singing it: that song to-night
       Will not go from my mind; I have much to do,
       But to go hang my head all at one side,
       And sing it like poor Barbara. Prithee, dispatch.

     * Emilia. Shall I go fetch your night-gown? 3055

     * Desdemona. No, unpin me here.
       This Lodovico is a proper man.

     * Emilia. A very handsome man.

     * Desdemona. He speaks well.

     * Emilia. I know a lady in Venice would have walked barefoot 3060
       to Palestine for a touch of his nether lip.

     * Desdemona. [Singing] The poor soul sat sighing by a sycamore tree,
       Sing all a green willow:
       Her hand on her bosom, her head on her knee,
       Sing willow, willow, willow: 3065
       The fresh streams ran by her, and murmur'd her moans;
       Sing willow, willow, willow;
       Her salt tears fell from her, and soften'd the stones;
       Lay by these:—
       [Singing] 3070
       Sing willow, willow, willow;
       Prithee, hie thee; he'll come anon:—
       [Singing]
       Sing all a green willow must be my garland.
       Let nobody blame him; his scorn I approve,- 3075
       Nay, that's not next.—Hark! who is't that knocks?

     * Emilia. It's the wind.

     * Desdemona. [Singing] I call'd my love false love; but what
       said he then?
       Sing willow, willow, willow: 3080
       If I court moe women, you'll couch with moe men!
       So, get thee gone; good night Ate eyes do itch;
       Doth that bode weeping?

     * Emilia. 'Tis neither here nor there.

     * Desdemona. I have heard it said so. O, these men, these men! 3085
       Dost thou in conscience think,—tell me, Emilia,—
       That there be women do abuse their husbands
       In such gross kind?

     * Emilia. There be some such, no question.

     * Desdemona. Wouldst thou do such a deed for all the world? 3090

     * Emilia. Why, would not you?

     * Desdemona. No, by this heavenly light!

     * Emilia. Nor I neither by this heavenly light;
       I might do't as well i' the dark.

     * Desdemona. Wouldst thou do such a deed for all the world? 3095

     * Emilia. The world's a huge thing: it is a great price.
       For a small vice.

     * Desdemona. In troth, I think thou wouldst not.

     * Emilia. In troth, I think I should; and undo't when I had
       done. Marry, I would not do such a thing for a 3100
       joint-ring, nor for measures of lawn, nor for
       gowns, petticoats, nor caps, nor any petty
       exhibition; but for the whole world,—why, who would
       not make her husband a cuckold to make him a
       monarch? I should venture purgatory for't. 3105

     * Desdemona. Beshrew me, if I would do such a wrong
       For the whole world.

     * Emilia. Why the wrong is but a wrong i' the world: and
       having the world for your labour, tis a wrong in your
       own world, and you might quickly make it right. 3110

     * Desdemona. I do not think there is any such woman.

     * Emilia. Yes, a dozen; and as many to the vantage as would
       store the world they played for.
       But I do think it is their husbands' faults
       If wives do fall: say that they slack their duties, 3115
       And pour our treasures into foreign laps,
       Or else break out in peevish jealousies,
       Throwing restraint upon us; or say they strike us,
       Or scant our former having in despite;
       Why, we have galls, and though we have some grace, 3120
       Yet have we some revenge. Let husbands know
       Their wives have sense like them: they see and smell
       And have their palates both for sweet and sour,
       As husbands have. What is it that they do
       When they change us for others? Is it sport? 3125
       I think it is: and doth affection breed it?
       I think it doth: is't frailty that thus errs?
       It is so too: and have not we affections,
       Desires for sport, and frailty, as men have?
       Then let them use us well: else let them know, 3130
       The ills we do, their ills instruct us so.

     * Desdemona. Good night, good night: heaven me such uses send,
       Not to pick bad from bad, but by bad mend!

   [Exeunt]

   Act V, Scene 1

   Cyprus. A street.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   [Enter IAGO and RODERIGO]
     * Iago. Here, stand behind this bulk; straight will he come:
       Wear thy good rapier bare, and put it home:
       Quick, quick; fear nothing; I'll be at thy elbow:
       It makes us, or it mars us; think on that,
       And fix most firm thy resolution. 3140

     * Roderigo. Be near at hand; I may miscarry in't.

     * Iago. Here, at thy hand: be bold, and take thy stand.

   [Retires]
     * Roderigo. I have no great devotion to the deed;
       And yet he hath given me satisfying reasons: 3145
       'Tis but a man gone. Forth, my sword: he dies.

     * Iago. I have rubb'd this young quat almost to the sense,
       And he grows angry. Now, whether he kill Cassio,
       Or Cassio him, or each do kill the other,
       Every way makes my gain: live Roderigo, 3150
       He calls me to a restitution large
       Of gold and jewels that I bobb'd from him,
       As gifts to Desdemona;
       It must not be: if Cassio do remain,
       He hath a daily beauty in his life 3155
       That makes me ugly; and, besides, the Moor
       May unfold me to him; there stand I in much peril:
       No, he must die. But so: I hear him coming.

   [Enter CASSIO]
     * Roderigo. I know his gait, 'tis he.—Villain, thou diest! 3160

   [Makes a pass at CASSIO]
     * Cassio. That thrust had been mine enemy indeed,
       But that my coat is better than thou know'st
       I will make proof of thine.

   [Draws, and wounds RODERIGO]
     * Roderigo. O, I am slain!

   [IAGO from behind wounds CASSIO in the leg, and exit]
     * Cassio. I am maim'd for ever. Help, ho! murder! murder!

   [Falls]

   [Enter OTHELLO]
     * Othello. The voice of Cassio: Iago keeps his word.

     * Roderigo. O, villain that I am!

     * Othello. It is even so.

     * Cassio. O, help, ho! light! a surgeon!

     * Othello. 'Tis he:—O brave Iago, honest and just, 3175
       That hast such noble sense of thy friend's wrong!
       Thou teachest me. Minion, your dear lies dead,
       And your unblest fate hies: strumpet, I come.
       Forth of my heart those charms, thine eyes, are blotted;
       Thy bed, lust-stain'd, shall with lust's blood be spotted. 3180

   [Exit]

   [Enter LODOVICO and GRATIANO]
     * Cassio. What, ho! no watch? no passage? murder! murder!

     * Gratiano. 'Tis some mischance; the cry is very direful.

     * Cassio. O, help! 3185

     * Lodovico. Hark!

     * Roderigo. O wretched villain!

     * Lodovico. Two or three groan: it is a heavy night:
       These may be counterfeits: let's think't unsafe
       To come in to the cry without more help. 3190

     * Roderigo. Nobody come? then shall I bleed to death.

     * Lodovico. Hark!

   [Re-enter IAGO, with a light]
     * Gratiano. Here's one comes in his shirt, with light and weapons.

     * Iago. Who's there? whose noise is this that ones on murder? 3195

     * Lodovico. We do not know.

     * Iago. Did not you hear a cry?

     * Cassio. Here, here! for heaven's sake, help me!

     * Iago. What's the matter?

     * Gratiano. This is Othello's ancient, as I take it. 3200

     * Lodovico. The same indeed; a very valiant fellow.

     * Iago. What are you here that cry so grievously?

     * Cassio. Iago? O, I am spoil'd, undone by villains!
       Give me some help.

     * Iago. O me, lieutenant! what villains have done this? 3205

     * Cassio. I think that one of them is hereabout,
       And cannot make away.

     * Iago. O treacherous villains!
       What are you there? come in, and give some help.

   [To LODOVICO and GRATIANO]
     * Roderigo. O, help me here!

     * Cassio. That's one of them.

     * Iago. O murderous slave! O villain!

   [Stabs RODERIGO]
     * Roderigo. O damn'd Iago! O inhuman dog! 3215

     * Iago. Kill men i' the dark!—Where be these bloody thieves?—
       How silent is this town!—Ho! murder! murder!—
       What may you be? are you of good or evil?

     * Lodovico. As you shall prove us, praise us.

     * Iago. Signior Lodovico? 3220

     * Lodovico. He, sir.

     * Iago. I cry you mercy. Here's Cassio hurt by villains.

     * Gratiano. Cassio!

     * Iago. How is't, brother!

     * Cassio. My leg is cut in two. 3225

     * Iago. Marry, heaven forbid!
       Light, gentlemen; I'll bind it with my shirt.

   [Enter BIANCA]
     * Bianca. What is the matter, ho? who is't that cried?

     * Iago. Who is't that cried! 3230

     * Bianca. O my dear Cassio! my sweet Cassio! O Cassio,
       Cassio, Cassio!

     * Iago. O notable strumpet! Cassio, may you suspect
       Who they should be that have thus many led you?

     * Cassio. No. 3235

     * Gratiano. I am to find you thus: I have been to seek you.

     * Iago. Lend me a garter. So. O, for a chair,
       To bear him easily hence!

     * Bianca. Alas, he faints! O Cassio, Cassio, Cassio!

     * Iago. Gentlemen all, I do suspect this trash 3240
       To be a party in this injury.
       Patience awhile, good Cassio. Come, come;
       Lend me a light. Know we this face or no?
       Alas my friend and my dear countryman
       Roderigo! no:—yes, sure: O heaven! Roderigo. 3245

     * Gratiano. What, of Venice?

     * Iago. Even he, sir; did you know him?

     * Gratiano. Know him! ay.

     * Iago. Signior Gratiano? I cry you gentle pardon;
       These bloody accidents must excuse my manners, 3250
       That so neglected you.

     * Gratiano. I am glad to see you.

     * Iago. How do you, Cassio? O, a chair, a chair!

     * Gratiano. Roderigo!

     * Iago. He, he 'tis he. 3255
       [A chair brought in]
       O, that's well said; the chair!

     * Gratiano. Some good man bear him carefully from hence;
       I'll fetch the general's surgeon.
       [To BIANCA] 3260
       For you, mistress,
       Save you your labour. He that lies slain
       here, Cassio,
       Was my dear friend: what malice was between you?

     * Cassio. None in the world; nor do I know the man. 3265

     * Iago. [To BIANCA] What, look you pale? O, bear him out
       o' the air.
       [CASSIO and RODERIGO are borne off]
       Stay you, good gentlemen. Look you pale, mistress?
       Do you perceive the gastness of her eye? 3270
       Nay, if you stare, we shall hear more anon.
       Behold her well; I pray you, look upon her:
       Do you see, gentlemen? nay, guiltiness will speak,
       Though tongues were out of use.

   [Enter EMILIA]
     * Emilia. 'Las, what's the matter? what's the matter, husband?

     * Iago. Cassio hath here been set on in the dark
       By Roderigo and fellows that are scaped:
       He's almost slain, and Roderigo dead.

     * Emilia. Alas, good gentleman! alas, good Cassio! 3280

     * Iago. This is the fruit of whoring. Prithee, Emilia,
       Go know of Cassio where he supp'd to-night.
       [To BIANCA]
       What, do you shake at that?

     * Bianca. He supp'd at my house; but I therefore shake not. 3285

     * Iago. O, did he so? I charge you, go with me.

     * Emilia. Fie, fie upon thee, strumpet!

     * Bianca. I am no strumpet; but of life as honest
       As you that thus abuse me.

     * Emilia. As I! foh! fie upon thee! 3290

     * Iago. Kind gentlemen, let's go see poor Cassio dress'd.
       Come, mistress, you must tell's another tale.
       Emilia run you to the citadel,
       And tell my lord and lady what hath happ'd.
       Will you go on? I pray. 3295
       [Aside]
       This is the night
       That either makes me or fordoes me quite.

   [Exeunt]
   _______________________________________________________________________



   Act V, Scene 2

   A bedchamber in the castle: DESDEMONA in bed asleep;
   _______________________________________________________________________

   a light burning.

   [Enter OTHELLO]
     * Othello. It is the cause, it is the cause, my soul,—
       Let me not name it to you, you chaste stars!—
       It is the cause. Yet I'll not shed her blood;
       Nor scar that whiter skin of hers than snow, 3305
       And smooth as monumental alabaster.
       Yet she must die, else she'll betray more men.
       Put out the light, and then put out the light:
       If I quench thee, thou flaming minister,
       I can again thy former light restore, 3310
       Should I repent me: but once put out thy light,
       Thou cunning'st pattern of excelling nature,
       I know not where is that Promethean heat
       That can thy light relume. When I have pluck'd the rose,
       I cannot give it vital growth again. 3315
       It must needs wither: I'll smell it on the tree.
       [Kissing her]
       Ah balmy breath, that dost almost persuade
       Justice to break her sword! One more, one more.
       Be thus when thou art dead, and I will kill thee, 3320
       And love thee after. One more, and this the last:
       So sweet was ne'er so fatal. I must weep,
       But they are cruel tears: this sorrow's heavenly;
       It strikes where it doth love. She wakes.

     * Desdemona. Who's there? Othello? 3325

     * Othello. Ay. Desdemona.

     * Desdemona. Will you come to bed, my lord?

     * Othello. Have you pray'd to-night, Desdemona?

     * Desdemona. Ay, my lord.

     * Othello. If you bethink yourself of any crime 3330
       Unreconciled as yet to heaven and grace,
       Solicit for it straight.

     * Desdemona. Alas, my lord, what do you mean by that?

     * Othello. Well, do it, and be brief; I will walk by:
       I would not kill thy unprepared spirit; 3335
       No; heaven forfend! I would not kill thy soul.

     * Desdemona. Talk you of killing?

     * Othello. Ay, I do.

     * Desdemona. Then heaven
       Have mercy on me! 3340

     * Othello. Amen, with all my heart!

     * Desdemona. If you say so, I hope you will not kill me.

     * Othello. Hum!

     * Desdemona. And yet I fear you; for you are fatal then
       When your eyes roll so: why I should fear I know not, 3345
       Since guiltiness I know not; but yet I feel I fear.

     * Othello. Think on thy sins.

     * Desdemona. They are loves I bear to you.

     * Othello. Ay, and for that thou diest.

     * Desdemona. That death's unnatural that kills for loving. 3350
       Alas, why gnaw you so your nether lip?
       Some bloody passion shakes your very frame:
       These are portents; but yet I hope, I hope,
       They do not point on me.

     * Othello. Peace, and be still! 3355

     * Desdemona. I will so. What's the matter?

     * Othello. That handkerchief which I so loved and gave thee
       Thou gavest to Cassio.

     * Desdemona. No, by my life and soul!
       Send for the man, and ask him. 3360

     * Othello. Sweet soul, take heed,
       Take heed of perjury; thou art on thy deathbed.

     * Desdemona. Ay, but not yet to die.

     * Othello. Yes, presently:
       Therefore confess thee freely of thy sin; 3365
       For to deny each article with oath
       Cannot remove nor choke the strong conception
       That I do groan withal. Thou art to die.

     * Desdemona. Then Lord have mercy on me!

     * Othello. I say, amen. 3370

     * Desdemona. And have you mercy too! I never did
       Offend you in my life; never loved Cassio
       But with such general warranty of heaven
       As I might love: I never gave him token.

     * Othello. By heaven, I saw my handkerchief in's hand. 3375
       O perjured woman! thou dost stone my heart,
       And makest me call what I intend to do
       A murder, which I thought a sacrifice:
       I saw the handkerchief.

     * Desdemona. He found it then; 3380
       I never gave it him: send for him hither;
       Let him confess a truth.

     * Othello. He hath confess'd.

     * Desdemona. What, my lord?

     * Othello. That he hath used thee. 3385

     * Desdemona. How? unlawfully?

     * Othello. Ay.

     * Desdemona. He will not say so.

     * Othello. No, his mouth is stopp'd;
       Honest Iago hath ta'en order for't. 3390

     * Desdemona. O! my fear interprets: what, is he dead?

     * Othello. Had all his hairs been lives, my great revenge
       Had stomach for them all.

     * Desdemona. Alas! he is betray'd and I undone.

     * Othello. Out, strumpet! weep'st thou for him to my face? 3395

     * Desdemona. O, banish me, my lord, but kill me not!

     * Othello. Down, strumpet!

     * Desdemona. Kill me to-morrow: let me live to-night!

     * Othello. Nay, if you strive—

     * Desdemona. But half an hour! 3400

     * Othello. Being done, there is no pause.

     * Desdemona. But while I say one prayer!

     * Othello. It is too late.

   [He stifles her]
     * Emilia. [Within] My lord, my lord! what, ho! my lord, my lord! 3405

     * Othello. What noise is this? Not dead? not yet quite dead?
       I that am cruel am yet merciful;
       I would not have thee linger in thy pain: So, so.

     * Emilia. [Within] What, ho! my lord, my lord!

     * Othello. Who's there? 3410

     * Emilia. [Within] O, good my lord, I would speak a word with you!

     * Othello. Yes: 'tis Emilia. By and by. She's dead.
       'Tis like she comes to speak of Cassio's death.—
       The noise was here. Ha! no more moving?
       Still as the grave. Shall she come in? were't good?— 3415
       I think she stirs again:—no. What's best to do?
       If she come in, she'll sure speak to my wife:
       My wife! my wife! what wife? I have no wife.
       O insupportable! O heavy hour!
       Methinks it should be now a huge eclipse 3420
       Of sun and moon, and that the affrighted globe
       Should yawn at alteration.

     * Emilia. [Within] I do beseech you
       That I may speak with you, O, good my lord!

     * Othello. I had forgot thee: O, come in, Emilia; 3425
       Soft; by and by. Let me the curtains draw.
       Where art thou?
       [Unlocks the door]
       [Enter EMILIA]
       What's the matter with thee now? 3430

     * Emilia. O, my good lord, yonder's foul murders done!

     * Othello. What, now?

     * Emilia. But now, my lord.

     * Othello. It is the very error of the moon;
       She comes more nearer earth than she was wont, 3435
       And makes men mad.

     * Emilia. Cassio, my lord, hath kill'd a young Venetian
       Call'd Roderigo.

     * Othello. Roderigo kill'd!
       And Cassio kill'd! 3440

     * Emilia. No, Cassio is not kill'd.

     * Othello. Not Cassio kill'd! then murder's out of tune,
       And sweet revenge grows harsh.

     * Desdemona. O, falsely, falsely murder'd!

     * Emilia. Alas, what cry is that? 3445

     * Othello. That! what?

     * Emilia. Out, and alas! that was my lady's voice.
       Help! help, ho! help! O lady, speak again!
       Sweet Desdemona! O sweet mistress, speak!

     * Desdemona. A guiltless death I die. 3450

     * Emilia. O, who hath done this deed?

     * Desdemona. Nobody; I myself. Farewell
       Commend me to my kind lord: O, farewell!

   [Dies]
     * Othello. Why, how should she be murder'd? 3455

     * Emilia. Alas, who knows?

     * Othello. You heard her say herself, it was not I.

     * Emilia. She said so: I must needs report the truth.

     * Othello. She's, like a liar, gone to burning hell:
       'Twas I that kill'd her. 3460

     * Emilia. O, the more angel she,
       And you the blacker devil!

     * Othello. She turn'd to folly, and she was a whore.

     * Emilia. Thou dost belie her, and thou art a devil.

     * Othello. She was false as water. 3465

     * Emilia. Thou art rash as fire, to say
       That she was false: O, she was heavenly true!

     * Othello. Cassio did top her; ask thy husband else.
       O, I were damn'd beneath all depth in hell,
       But that I did proceed upon just grounds 3470
       To this extremity. Thy husband knew it all.

     * Emilia. My husband!

     * Othello. Thy husband.

     * Emilia. That she was false to wedlock?

     * Othello. Ay, with Cassio. Nay, had she been true, 3475
       If heaven would make me such another world
       Of one entire and Perfect chrysolite,
       I'ld not have sold her for it.

     * Emilia. My husband!

     * Othello. Ay, 'twas he that told me first: 3480
       An honest man he is, and hates the slime
       That sticks on filthy deeds.

     * Emilia. My husband!

     * Othello. What needs this iteration, woman? I say thy husband.

     * Emilia. O mistress, villany hath made mocks with love, 3485
       My husband say that she was false!

     * Othello. He, woman;
       I say thy husband: dost understand the word?
       My friend, thy husband, honest, honest Iago.

     * Emilia. If he say so, may his pernicious soul 3490
       Rot half a grain a day! he lies to the heart:
       She was too fond of her most filthy bargain.

     * Othello. Ha!

     * Emilia. Do thy worst:
       This deed of thine is no more worthy heaven 3495
       Than thou wast worthy her.

     * Othello. Peace, you were best.

     * Emilia. Thou hast not half that power to do me harm
       As I have to be hurt. O gull! O dolt!
       As ignorant as dirt! thou hast done a deed— 3500
       I care not for thy sword; I'll make thee known,
       Though I lost twenty lives.—Help! help, ho! help!
       The Moor hath kill'd my mistress! Murder! murder!

   [Enter MONTANO, GRATIANO, IAGO, and others]
     * Montano. What is the matter? How now, general! 3505

     * Emilia. O, are you come, Iago? you have done well,
       That men must lay their murders on your neck.

     * Gratiano. What is the matter?

     * Emilia. Disprove this villain, if thou be'st a man:
       He says thou told'st him that his wife was false: 3510
       I know thou didst not, thou'rt not such a villain:
       Speak, for my heart is full.

     * Iago. I told him what I thought, and told no more
       Than what he found himself was apt and true.

     * Emilia. But did you ever tell him she was false? 3515

     * Iago. I did.

     * Emilia. You told a lie, an odious, damned lie;
       Upon my soul, a lie, a wicked lie.
       She false with Cassio!—did you say with Cassio?

     * Iago. With Cassio, mistress. Go to, charm your tongue. 3520

     * Emilia. I will not charm my tongue; I am bound to speak:
       My mistress here lies murder'd in her bed,—

     * All. O heavens forfend!

     * Emilia. And your reports have set the murder on.

     * Othello. Nay, stare not, masters: it is true, indeed. 3525

     * Gratiano. 'Tis a strange truth.

     * Montano. O monstrous act!

     * Emilia. Villany, villany, villany!
       I think upon't, I think: I smell't: O villany!—
       I thought so then:—I'll kill myself for grief:— 3530
       O villany, villany!

     * Iago. What, are you mad? I charge you, get you home.

     * Emilia. Good gentlemen, let me have leave to speak:
       'Tis proper I obey him, but not now.
       Perchance, Iago, I will ne'er go home. 3535

     * Othello. O! O! O!

   [He falls on the bed]
     * Emilia. Nay, lay thee down and roar;
       For thou hast kill'd the sweetest innocent
       That e'er did lift up eye. 3540

     * Othello. [Rising] O, she was foul!
       I scarce did know you, uncle: there lies your niece,
       Whose breath, indeed, these hands have newly stopp'd:
       I know this act shows horrible and grim.

     * Gratiano. Poor Desdemona! I am glad thy father's dead: 3545
       Thy match was mortal to him, and pure grief
       Shore his old thread in twain: did he live now,
       This sight would make him do a desperate turn,
       Yea, curse his better angel from his side,
       And fall to reprobation. 3550

     * Othello. 'Tis pitiful; but yet Iago knows
       That she with Cassio hath the act of shame
       A thousand times committed; Cassio confess'd it:
       And she did gratify his amorous works
       With that recognizance and pledge of love 3555
       Which I first gave her; I saw it in his hand:
       It was a handkerchief, an antique token
       My father gave my mother.

     * Emilia. O heaven! O heavenly powers!

     * Iago. Come, hold your peace. 3560

     * Emilia. 'Twill out, 'twill out: I peace!
       No, I will speak as liberal as the north:
       Let heaven and men and devils, let them all,
       All, all, cry shame against me, yet I'll speak.

     * Iago. Be wise, and get you home. 3565

     * Emilia. I will not.

   [IAGO offers to stab EMILIA]
     * Gratiano. Fie!
       Your sword upon a woman?

     * Emilia. O thou dull Moor! that handkerchief thou speak'st of 3570
       I found by fortune and did give my husband;
       For often, with a solemn earnestness,
       More than indeed belong'd to such a trifle,
       He begg'd of me to steal it.

     * Iago. Villanous whore! 3575

     * Emilia. She give it Cassio! no, alas! I found it,
       And I did give't my husband.

     * Iago. Filth, thou liest!

     * Emilia. By heaven, I do not, I do not, gentlemen.
       O murderous coxcomb! what should such a fool 3580
       Do with so good a woman?

     * Othello. Are there no stones in heaven
       But what serve for the thunder?—Precious villain!

   [He runs at IAGO IAGO, from behind, stabs EMILIA, and exit]
     * Gratiano. The woman falls; sure, he hath kill'd his wife. 3585

     * Emilia. Ay, ay: O, lay me by my mistress' side.

     * Gratiano. He's gone, but his wife's kill'd.

     * Montano. 'Tis a notorious villain. Take you this weapon,
       Which I have here recover'd from the Moor:
       Come, guard the door without; let him not pass, 3590
       But kill him rather. I'll after that same villain,
       For 'tis a damned slave.

   [Exeunt MONTANO and GRATIANO]
     * Othello. I am not valiant neither,
       But ever puny whipster gets my sword: 3595
       But why should honour outlive honesty?
       Let it go all.

     * Emilia. What did thy song bode, lady?
       Hark, canst thou hear me? I will play the swan.
       And die in music. 3600
       [Singing]
       Willow, willow, willow,—
       Moor, she was chaste; she loved thee, cruel Moor;
       So come my soul to bliss, as I speak true;
       So speaking as I think, I die, I die. 3605

   [Dies]
     * Othello. I have another weapon in this chamber;
       It is a sword of Spain, the ice-brook's temper:—
       O, here it is. Uncle, I must come forth.

     * Gratiano. [Within] If thou attempt it, it will cost thee dear: 3610
       Thou hast no weapon, and perforce must suffer.

     * Othello. Look in upon me then and speak with me,
       Or, naked as I am, I will assault thee.

   [Re-enter GRATIANO]
     * Gratiano. What is the matter? 3615

     * Othello. Behold, I have a weapon;
       A better never did itself sustain
       Upon a soldier's thigh: I have seen the day,
       That, with this little arm and this good sword,
       I have made my way through more impediments 3620
       Than twenty times your stop: but, O vain boast!
       Who can control his fate? 'tis not so now.
       Be not afraid, though you do see me weapon'd;
       Here is my journey's end, here is my butt,
       And very sea-mark of my utmost sail. 3625
       Do you go back dismay'd? 'tis a lost fear;
       Man but a rush against Othello's breast,
       And he retires. Where should Othello go?
       Now, how dost thou look now? O ill-starr'd wench!
       Pale as thy smock! when we shall meet at compt, 3630
       This look of thine will hurl my soul from heaven,
       And fiends will snatch at it. Cold, cold, my girl!
       Even like thy chastity. O cursed slave!
       Whip me, ye devils,
       From the possession of this heavenly sight! 3635
       Blow me about in winds! roast me in sulphur!
       Wash me in steep-down gulfs of liquid fire!
       O Desdemona! Desdemona! dead!
       Oh! Oh! Oh!
       [Enter LODOVICO. MONTANO, CASSIO carried in a chair,] 3640
       and Officers with IAGO, prisoner]

     * Lodovico. Where is this rash and most unfortunate man?

     * Othello. That's he that was Othello: here I am.

     * Lodovico. Where is that viper? bring the villain forth.

     * Othello. I look down towards his feet; but that's a fable. 3645
       If that thou best a devil, I cannot kill thee.

   [Wounds IAGO]
     * Lodovico. Wrench his sword from him.

     * Iago. I bleed, sir; but not kill'd.

     * Othello. I am not sorry neither: I'ld have thee live; 3650
       For, in my sense, 'tis happiness to die.

     * Lodovico. O thou Othello, thou wert once so good,
       Fall'n in the practise of a damned slave,
       What shall be said to thee?

     * Othello. Why, any thing: 3655
       An honourable murderer, if you will;
       For nought I did in hate, but all in honour.

     * Lodovico. This wretch hath part confess'd his villany:
       Did you and he consent in Cassio's death?

     * Othello. Ay. 3660

     * Cassio. Dear general, I never gave you cause.

     * Othello. I do believe it, and I ask your pardon.
       Will you, I pray, demand that demi-devil
       Why he hath thus ensnared my soul and body?

     * Iago. Demand me nothing: what you know, you know: 3665
       From this time forth I never will speak word.

     * Lodovico. What, not to pray?

     * Gratiano. Torments will ope your lips.

     * Othello. Well, thou dost best.

     * Lodovico. Sir, you shall understand what hath befall'n, 3670
       Which, as I think, you know not. Here is a letter
       Found in the pocket of the slain Roderigo;
       And here another: the one of them imports
       The death of Cassio to be undertook
       By Roderigo. 3675

     * Othello. O villain!

     * Cassio. Most heathenish and most gross!

     * Lodovico. Now here's another discontented paper,
       Found in his pocket too; and this, it seems,
       Roderigo meant to have sent this damned villain; 3680
       But that belike Iago in the interim
       Came in and satisfied him.

     * Othello. O the pernicious caitiff!
       How came you, Cassio, by that handkerchief
       That was my wife's? 3685

     * Cassio. I found it in my chamber:
       And he himself confess'd but even now
       That there he dropp'd it for a special purpose
       Which wrought to his desire.

     * Othello. O fool! fool! fool! 3690

     * Cassio. There is besides in Roderigo's letter,
       How he upbraids Iago, that he made him
       Brave me upon the watch; whereon it came
       That I was cast: and even but now he spake,
       After long seeming dead, Iago hurt him, 3695
       Iago set him on.

     * Lodovico. You must forsake this room, and go with us:
       Your power and your command is taken off,
       And Cassio rules in Cyprus. For this slave,
       If there be any cunning cruelty 3700
       That can torment him much and hold him long,
       It shall be his. You shall close prisoner rest,
       Till that the nature of your fault be known
       To the Venetian state. Come, bring him away.

     * Othello. Soft you; a word or two before you go. 3705
       I have done the state some service, and they know't.
       No more of that. I pray you, in your letters,
       When you shall these unlucky deeds relate,
       Speak of me as I am; nothing extenuate,
       Nor set down aught in malice: then must you speak 3710
       Of one that loved not wisely but too well;
       Of one not easily jealous, but being wrought
       Perplex'd in the extreme; of one whose hand,
       Like the base Indian, threw a pearl away
       Richer than all his tribe; of one whose subdued eyes, 3715
       Albeit unused to the melting mood,
       Drop tears as fast as the Arabian trees
       Their medicinal gum. Set you down this;
       And say besides, that in Aleppo once,
       Where a malignant and a turban'd Turk 3720
       Beat a Venetian and traduced the state,
       I took by the throat the circumcised dog,
       And smote him, thus.

   [Stabs himself]
     * Lodovico. O bloody period! 3725

     * Gratiano. All that's spoke is marr'd.

     * Othello. I kiss'd thee ere I kill'd thee: no way but this;
       Killing myself, to die upon a kiss.

   [Falls on the bed, and dies]
     * Cassio. This did I fear, but thought he had no weapon; 3730
       For he was great of heart.

     * Lodovico. [To IAGO] O Spartan dog,
       More fell than anguish, hunger, or the sea!
       Look on the tragic loading of this bed;
       This is thy work: the object poisons sight; 3735
       Let it be hid. Gratiano, keep the house,
       And seize upon the fortunes of the Moor,
       For they succeed on you. To you, lord governor,
       Remains the censure of this hellish villain;
       The time, the place, the torture: O, enforce it! 3740
       Myself will straight aboard: and to the state
       This heavy act with heavy heart relate.

   [Exeunt]
