                  Alack, what poverty my Muse brings forth,
                 That having such a scope to show her pride,
                   The argument all bare is of more worth
                  Than when it hath my added praise beside!

                  That over-goes my blunt invention quite,
                   Dulling my lines and doing me disgrace.

                 To mar the subject that before was well? 10
                     For to no other pass my verses tend
                 Than of your graces and your gifts to tell;
                  And more, much more, than in my verse can sit
                Your own glass shows you when you look in it. 14
