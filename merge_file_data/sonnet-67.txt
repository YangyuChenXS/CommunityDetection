                                SONNET LXVII

                Ah! wherefore with infection should he live,
                    And with his presence grace impiety,
                  That sin by him advantage should achieve
                      And lace itself with his society?

                  And steal dead seeing of his living hue?
                   Why should poor beauty indirectly seek
                  Roses of shadow, since his rose is true?
                 Why should he live, now Nature bankrupt is,
             Beggar'd of blood to blush through lively veins? 10
                   For she hath no exchequer now but his,
                  And, proud of many, lives upon his gains.
                 O, him she stores, to show what wealth she had
                In days long since, before these last so bad. 14
