   [Enter KING HENRY, LORD JOHN OF LANCASTER, the EARL of WESTMORELAND,
   SIR WALTER BLUNT, and others]
     * Henry IV. So shaken as we are, so wan with care,
       Find we a time for frighted peace to pant,
       And breathe short-winded accents of new broils
       To be commenced in strands afar remote. 5
       No more the thirsty entrance of this soil
       Shall daub her lips with her own children's blood;
       Nor more shall trenching war channel her fields,
       Nor bruise her flowerets with the armed hoofs
       Of hostile paces: those opposed eyes, 10
       Which, like the meteors of a troubled heaven,
       All of one nature, of one substance bred,
       Did lately meet in the intestine shock
       And furious close of civil butchery
       Shall now, in mutual well-beseeming ranks, 15
       March all one way and be no more opposed
       Against acquaintance, kindred and allies:
       The edge of war, like an ill-sheathed knife,
       No more shall cut his master. Therefore, friends,
       As far as to the sepulchre of Christ, 20
       Whose soldier now, under whose blessed cross
       We are impressed and engaged to fight,
       Forthwith a power of English shall we levy;
       Whose arms were moulded in their mothers' womb
       To chase these pagans in those holy fields 25
       Over whose acres walk'd those blessed feet
       Which fourteen hundred years ago were nail'd
       For our advantage on the bitter cross.
       But this our purpose now is twelve month old,
       And bootless 'tis to tell you we will go: 30
       Therefore we meet not now. Then let me hear
       Of you, my gentle cousin Westmoreland,
       What yesternight our council did decree
       In forwarding this dear expedience.

     * Earl of Westmoreland. My liege, this haste was hot in question, 35
       And many limits of the charge set down
       But yesternight: when all athwart there came
       A post from Wales loaden with heavy news;
       Whose worst was, that the noble Mortimer,
       Leading the men of Herefordshire to fight 40
       Against the irregular and wild Glendower,
       Was by the rude hands of that Welshman taken,
       A thousand of his people butchered;
       Upon whose dead corpse there was such misuse,
       Such beastly shameless transformation, 45
       By those Welshwomen done as may not be
       Without much shame retold or spoken of.

     * Henry IV. It seems then that the tidings of this broil
       Brake off our business for the Holy Land.

     * Earl of Westmoreland. This match'd with other did, my gracious
       lord; 50
       For more uneven and unwelcome news
       Came from the north and thus it did import:
       On Holy-rood day, the gallant Hotspur there,
       Young Harry Percy and brave Archibald,
       That ever-valiant and approved Scot, 55
       At Holmedon met,
       Where they did spend a sad and bloody hour,
       As by discharge of their artillery,
       And shape of likelihood, the news was told;
       For he that brought them, in the very heat 60
       And pride of their contention did take horse,
       Uncertain of the issue any way.

     * Henry IV. Here is a dear, a true industrious friend,
       Sir Walter Blunt, new lighted from his horse.
       Stain'd with the variation of each soil 65
       Betwixt that Holmedon and this seat of ours;
       And he hath brought us smooth and welcome news.
       The Earl of Douglas is discomfited:
       Ten thousand bold Scots, two and twenty knights,
       Balk'd in their own blood did Sir Walter see 70
       On Holmedon's plains. Of prisoners, Hotspur took
       Mordake the Earl of Fife, and eldest son
       To beaten Douglas; and the Earl of Athol,
       Of Murray, Angus, and Menteith:
       And is not this an honourable spoil? 75
       A gallant prize? ha, cousin, is it not?

     * Earl of Westmoreland. In faith,
       It is a conquest for a prince to boast of.

     * Henry IV. Yea, there thou makest me sad and makest me sin
       In envy that my Lord Northumberland 80
       Should be the father to so blest a son,
       A son who is the theme of honour's tongue;
       Amongst a grove, the very straightest plant;
       Who is sweet Fortune's minion and her pride:
       Whilst I, by looking on the praise of him, 85
       See riot and dishonour stain the brow
       Of my young Harry. O that it could be proved
       That some night-tripping fairy had exchanged
       In cradle-clothes our children where they lay,
       And call'd mine Percy, his Plantagenet! 90
       Then would I have his Harry, and he mine.
       But let him from my thoughts. What think you, coz,
       Of this young Percy's pride? the prisoners,
       Which he in this adventure hath surprised,
       To his own use he keeps; and sends me word, 95
       I shall have none but Mordake Earl of Fife.

     * Earl of Westmoreland. This is his uncle's teaching; this is
       Worcester,
       Malevolent to you in all aspects;
       Which makes him prune himself, and bristle up
       The crest of youth against your dignity. 100

     * Henry IV. But I have sent for him to answer this;
       And for this cause awhile we must neglect
       Our holy purpose to Jerusalem.
       Cousin, on Wednesday next our council we
       Will hold at Windsor; so inform the lords: 105
       But come yourself with speed to us again;
       For more is to be said and to be done
       Than out of anger can be uttered.

     * Earl of Westmoreland. I will, my liege.

   [Exeunt]

   Act I, Scene 2

   London. An apartment of the Prince’s.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   [Enter the PRINCE OF WALES and FALSTAFF]
     * Falstaff. Now, Hal, what time of day is it, lad?

     * Henry V. Thou art so fat-witted, with drinking of old sack
       and unbuttoning thee after supper and sleeping upon
       benches after noon, that thou hast forgotten to 115
       demand that truly which thou wouldst truly know.
       What a devil hast thou to do with the time of the
       day? Unless hours were cups of sack and minutes
       capons and clocks the tongues of bawds and dials the
       signs of leaping-houses and the blessed sun himself 120
       a fair hot wench in flame-coloured taffeta, I see no
       reason why thou shouldst be so superfluous to demand
       the time of the day.

     * Falstaff. Indeed, you come near me now, Hal; for we that take
       purses go by the moon and the seven stars, and not 125
       by Phoebus, he,'that wandering knight so fair.' And,
       I prithee, sweet wag, when thou art king, as, God
       save thy grace,—majesty I should say, for grace
       thou wilt have none,—

     * Henry V. What, none? 130

     * Falstaff. No, by my troth, not so much as will serve to
       prologue to an egg and butter.

     * Henry V. Well, how then? come, roundly, roundly.

     * Falstaff. Marry, then, sweet wag, when thou art king, let not
       us that are squires of the night's body be called 135
       thieves of the day's beauty: let us be Diana's
       foresters, gentlemen of the shade, minions of the
       moon; and let men say we be men of good government,
       being governed, as the sea is, by our noble and
       chaste mistress the moon, under whose countenance we steal. 140

     * Henry V. Thou sayest well, and it holds well too; for the
       fortune of us that are the moon's men doth ebb and
       flow like the sea, being governed, as the sea is,
       by the moon. As, for proof, now: a purse of gold
       most resolutely snatched on Monday night and most 145
       dissolutely spent on Tuesday morning; got with
       swearing 'Lay by' and spent with crying 'Bring in;'
       now in as low an ebb as the foot of the ladder
       and by and by in as high a flow as the ridge of the gallows.

     * Falstaff. By the Lord, thou sayest true, lad. And is not my 150
       hostess of the tavern a most sweet wench?

     * Henry V. As the honey of Hybla, my old lad of the castle. And
       is not a buff jerkin a most sweet robe of durance?

     * Falstaff. How now, how now, mad wag! what, in thy quips and
       thy quiddities? what a plague have I to do with a 155
       buff jerkin?

     * Henry V. Why, what a pox have I to do with my hostess of the
       tavern?

     * Falstaff. Well, thou hast called her to a reckoning many a
       time and oft.

     * Henry V. Did I ever call for thee to pay thy part? 160

     * Falstaff. No; I'll give thee thy due, thou hast paid all there.

     * Henry V. Yea, and elsewhere, so far as my coin would stretch;
       and where it would not, I have used my credit.

     * Falstaff. Yea, and so used it that were it not here apparent
       that thou art heir apparent—But, I prithee, sweet 165
       wag, shall there be gallows standing in England when
       thou art king? and resolution thus fobbed as it is
       with the rusty curb of old father antic the law? Do
       not thou, when thou art king, hang a thief.

     * Henry V. No; thou shalt. 170

     * Falstaff. Shall I? O rare! By the Lord, I'll be a brave judge.

     * Henry V. Thou judgest false already: I mean, thou shalt have
       the hanging of the thieves and so become a rare hangman.

     * Falstaff. Well, Hal, well; and in some sort it jumps with my
       humour as well as waiting in the court, I can tell 175
       you.

     * Henry V. For obtaining of suits?

     * Falstaff. Yea, for obtaining of suits, whereof the hangman
       hath no lean wardrobe. 'Sblood, I am as melancholy
       as a gib cat or a lugged bear. 180

     * Henry V. Or an old lion, or a lover's lute.

     * Falstaff. Yea, or the drone of a Lincolnshire bagpipe.

     * Henry V. What sayest thou to a hare, or the melancholy of
       Moor-ditch?

     * Falstaff. Thou hast the most unsavoury similes and art indeed 185
       the most comparative, rascalliest, sweet young
       prince. But, Hal, I prithee, trouble me no more
       with vanity. I would to God thou and I knew where a
       commodity of good names were to be bought. An old
       lord of the council rated me the other day in the 190
       street about you, sir, but I marked him not; and yet
       he talked very wisely, but I regarded him not; and
       yet he talked wisely, and in the street too.

     * Henry V. Thou didst well; for wisdom cries out in the
       streets, and no man regards it. 195

     * Falstaff. O, thou hast damnable iteration and art indeed able
       to corrupt a saint. Thou hast done much harm upon
       me, Hal; God forgive thee for it! Before I knew
       thee, Hal, I knew nothing; and now am I, if a man
       should speak truly, little better than one of the 200
       wicked. I must give over this life, and I will give
       it over: by the Lord, and I do not, I am a villain:
       I'll be damned for never a king's son in
       Christendom.

     * Henry V. Where shall we take a purse tomorrow, Jack? 205

     * Falstaff. 'Zounds, where thou wilt, lad; I'll make one; an I
       do not, call me villain and baffle me.

     * Henry V. I see a good amendment of life in thee; from praying
       to purse-taking.

     * Falstaff. Why, Hal, 'tis my vocation, Hal; 'tis no sin for a 210
       man to labour in his vocation.
       [Enter POINS]
       Poins! Now shall we know if Gadshill have set a
       match. O, if men were to be saved by merit, what
       hole in hell were hot enough for him? This is the 215
       most omnipotent villain that ever cried 'Stand' to
       a true man.

     * Henry V. Good morrow, Ned.

     * Edward Poins. Good morrow, sweet Hal. What says Monsieur Remorse?
       what says Sir John Sack and Sugar? Jack! how 220
       agrees the devil and thee about thy soul, that thou
       soldest him on Good-Friday last for a cup of Madeira
       and a cold capon's leg?

     * Henry V. Sir John stands to his word, the devil shall have
       his bargain; for he was never yet a breaker of 225
       proverbs: he will give the devil his due.

     * Edward Poins. Then art thou damned for keeping thy word with the
       devil.

     * Henry V. Else he had been damned for cozening the devil.

     * Edward Poins. But, my lads, my lads, to-morrow morning, by four
       o'clock, early at Gadshill! there are pilgrims going 230
       to Canterbury with rich offerings, and traders
       riding to London with fat purses: I have vizards
       for you all; you have horses for yourselves:
       Gadshill lies to-night in Rochester: I have bespoke
       supper to-morrow night in Eastcheap: we may do it 235
       as secure as sleep. If you will go, I will stuff
       your purses full of crowns; if you will not, tarry
       at home and be hanged.

     * Falstaff. Hear ye, Yedward; if I tarry at home and go not,
       I'll hang you for going. 240

     * Edward Poins. You will, chops?

     * Falstaff. Hal, wilt thou make one?

     * Henry V. Who, I rob? I a thief? not I, by my faith.

     * Falstaff. There's neither honesty, manhood, nor good
       fellowship in thee, nor thou camest not of the blood 245
       royal, if thou darest not stand for ten shillings.

     * Henry V. Well then, once in my days I'll be a madcap.

     * Falstaff. Why, that's well said.

     * Henry V. Well, come what will, I'll tarry at home.

     * Falstaff. By the Lord, I'll be a traitor then, when thou art king.
       250

     * Henry V. I care not.

     * Edward Poins. Sir John, I prithee, leave the prince and me alone:
       I will lay him down such reasons for this adventure
       that he shall go.

     * Falstaff. Well, God give thee the spirit of persuasion and him 255
       the ears of profiting, that what thou speakest may
       move and what he hears may be believed, that the
       true prince may, for recreation sake, prove a false
       thief; for the poor abuses of the time want
       countenance. Farewell: you shall find me in Eastcheap. 260

     * Henry V. Farewell, thou latter spring! farewell, All-hallown
       summer!

   [Exit Falstaff]
     * Edward Poins. Now, my good sweet honey lord, ride with us
       to-morrow: I have a jest to execute that I cannot
       manage alone. Falstaff, Bardolph, Peto and Gadshill 265
       shall rob those men that we have already waylaid:
       yourself and I will not be there; and when they
       have the booty, if you and I do not rob them, cut
       this head off from my shoulders.

     * Henry V. How shall we part with them in setting forth? 270

     * Edward Poins. Why, we will set forth before or after them, and
       appoint them a place of meeting, wherein it is at
       our pleasure to fail, and then will they adventure
       upon the exploit themselves; which they shall have
       no sooner achieved, but we'll set upon them. 275

     * Henry V. Yea, but 'tis like that they will know us by our
       horses, by our habits and by every other
       appointment, to be ourselves.

     * Edward Poins. Tut! our horses they shall not see: I'll tie them
       in the wood; our vizards we will change after we 280
       leave them: and, sirrah, I have cases of buckram
       for the nonce, to immask our noted outward garments.

     * Henry V. Yea, but I doubt they will be too hard for us.

     * Edward Poins. Well, for two of them, I know them to be as
       true-bred cowards as ever turned back; and for the 285
       third, if he fight longer than he sees reason, I'll
       forswear arms. The virtue of this jest will be, the
       incomprehensible lies that this same fat rogue will
       tell us when we meet at supper: how thirty, at
       least, he fought with; what wards, what blows, what 290
       extremities he endured; and in the reproof of this
       lies the jest.

     * Henry V. Well, I'll go with thee: provide us all things
       necessary and meet me to-morrow night in Eastcheap;
       there I'll sup. Farewell. 295

     * Edward Poins. Farewell, my lord.

   [Exit Poins]
     * Henry V. I know you all, and will awhile uphold
       The unyoked humour of your idleness:
       Yet herein will I imitate the sun, 300
       Who doth permit the base contagious clouds
       To smother up his beauty from the world,
       That, when he please again to be himself,
       Being wanted, he may be more wonder'd at,
       By breaking through the foul and ugly mists 305
       Of vapours that did seem to strangle him.
       If all the year were playing holidays,
       To sport would be as tedious as to work;
       But when they seldom come, they wish'd for come,
       And nothing pleaseth but rare accidents. 310
       So, when this loose behavior I throw off
       And pay the debt I never promised,
       By how much better than my word I am,
       By so much shall I falsify men's hopes;
       And like bright metal on a sullen ground, 315
       My reformation, glittering o'er my fault,
       Shall show more goodly and attract more eyes
       Than that which hath no foil to set it off.
       I'll so offend, to make offence a skill;
       Redeeming time when men think least I will. 320

   [Enter the KING, NORTHUMBERLAND, WORCESTER, HOTSPUR, SIR WALTER BLUNT,
   with others]
     * Henry IV. My blood hath been too cold and temperate,
       Unapt to stir at these indignities,
       And you have found me; for accordingly 325
       You tread upon my patience: but be sure
       I will from henceforth rather be myself,
       Mighty and to be fear'd, than my condition;
       Which hath been smooth as oil, soft as young down,
       And therefore lost that title of respect 330
       Which the proud soul ne'er pays but to the proud.

     * Earl of Worcester. Our house, my sovereign liege, little deserves
       The scourge of greatness to be used on it;
       And that same greatness too which our own hands
       Have holp to make so portly. 335

     * Earl of Northumberland. My lord.—

     * Henry IV. Worcester, get thee gone; for I do see
       Danger and disobedience in thine eye:
       O, sir, your presence is too bold and peremptory,
       And majesty might never yet endure 340
       The moody frontier of a servant brow.
       You have good leave to leave us: when we need
       Your use and counsel, we shall send for you.
       [Exit Worcester]
       You were about to speak. 345
       [To North]

     * Earl of Northumberland. Yea, my good lord.
       Those prisoners in your highness' name demanded,
       Which Harry Percy here at Holmedon took,
       Were, as he says, not with such strength denied 350
       As is deliver'd to your majesty:
       Either envy, therefore, or misprison
       Is guilty of this fault and not my son.

     * Hotspur (Henry Percy). My liege, I did deny no prisoners.
       But I remember, when the fight was done, 355
       When I was dry with rage and extreme toil,
       Breathless and faint, leaning upon my sword,
       Came there a certain lord, neat, and trimly dress'd,
       Fresh as a bridegroom; and his chin new reap'd
       Show'd like a stubble-land at harvest-home; 360
       He was perfumed like a milliner;
       And 'twixt his finger and his thumb he held
       A pouncet-box, which ever and anon
       He gave his nose and took't away again;
       Who therewith angry, when it next came there, 365
       Took it in snuff; and still he smiled and talk'd,
       And as the soldiers bore dead bodies by,
       He call'd them untaught knaves, unmannerly,
       To bring a slovenly unhandsome corse
       Betwixt the wind and his nobility. 370
       With many holiday and lady terms
       He question'd me; amongst the rest, demanded
       My prisoners in your majesty's behalf.
       I then, all smarting with my wounds being cold,
       To be so pester'd with a popinjay, 375
       Out of my grief and my impatience,
       Answer'd neglectingly I know not what,
       He should or he should not; for he made me mad
       To see him shine so brisk and smell so sweet
       And talk so like a waiting-gentlewoman 380
       Of guns and drums and wounds,—God save the mark!—
       And telling me the sovereign'st thing on earth
       Was parmaceti for an inward bruise;
       And that it was great pity, so it was,
       This villanous salt-petre should be digg'd 385
       Out of the bowels of the harmless earth,
       Which many a good tall fellow had destroy'd
       So cowardly; and but for these vile guns,
       He would himself have been a soldier.
       This bald unjointed chat of his, my lord, 390
       I answer'd indirectly, as I said;
       And I beseech you, let not his report
       Come current for an accusation
       Betwixt my love and your high majesty.

     * Blunt. The circumstance consider'd, good my lord, 395
       Whate'er Lord Harry Percy then had said
       To such a person and in such a place,
       At such a time, with all the rest retold,
       May reasonably die and never rise
       To do him wrong or any way impeach 400
       What then he said, so he unsay it now.

     * Henry IV. Why, yet he doth deny his prisoners,
       But with proviso and exception,
       That we at our own charge shall ransom straight
       His brother-in-law, the foolish Mortimer; 405
       Who, on my soul, hath wilfully betray'd
       The lives of those that he did lead to fight
       Against that great magician, damn'd Glendower,
       Whose daughter, as we hear, the Earl of March
       Hath lately married. Shall our coffers, then, 410
       Be emptied to redeem a traitor home?
       Shall we but treason? and indent with fears,
       When they have lost and forfeited themselves?
       No, on the barren mountains let him starve;
       For I shall never hold that man my friend 415
       Whose tongue shall ask me for one penny cost
       To ransom home revolted Mortimer.

     * Hotspur (Henry Percy). Revolted Mortimer!
       He never did fall off, my sovereign liege,
       But by the chance of war; to prove that true 420
       Needs no more but one tongue for all those wounds,
       Those mouthed wounds, which valiantly he took
       When on the gentle Severn's sedgy bank,
       In single opposition, hand to hand,
       He did confound the best part of an hour 425
       In changing hardiment with great Glendower:
       Three times they breathed and three times did
       they drink,
       Upon agreement, of swift Severn's flood;
       Who then, affrighted with their bloody looks, 430
       Ran fearfully among the trembling reeds,
       And hid his crisp head in the hollow bank,
       Bloodstained with these valiant combatants.
       Never did base and rotten policy
       Colour her working with such deadly wounds; 435
       Nor could the noble Mortimer
       Receive so many, and all willingly:
       Then let not him be slander'd with revolt.

     * Henry IV. Thou dost belie him, Percy, thou dost belie him;
       He never did encounter with Glendower: 440
       I tell thee,
       He durst as well have met the devil alone
       As Owen Glendower for an enemy.
       Art thou not ashamed? But, sirrah, henceforth
       Let me not hear you speak of Mortimer: 445
       Send me your prisoners with the speediest means,
       Or you shall hear in such a kind from me
       As will displease you. My Lord Northumberland,
       We licence your departure with your son.
       Send us your prisoners, or you will hear of it. 450

   [Exeunt King Henry, Blunt, and train]
     * Hotspur (Henry Percy). An if the devil come and roar for them,
       I will not send them: I will after straight
       And tell him so; for I will ease my heart,
       Albeit I make a hazard of my head. 455

     * Earl of Northumberland. What, drunk with choler? stay and pause
       awhile:
       Here comes your uncle.

   [Re-enter WORCESTER]
     * Hotspur (Henry Percy). Speak of Mortimer!
       'Zounds, I will speak of him; and let my soul 460
       Want mercy, if I do not join with him:
       Yea, on his part I'll empty all these veins,
       And shed my dear blood drop by drop in the dust,
       But I will lift the down-trod Mortimer
       As high in the air as this unthankful king, 465
       As this ingrate and canker'd Bolingbroke.

     * Earl of Northumberland. Brother, the king hath made your nephew
       mad.

     * Earl of Worcester. Who struck this heat up after I was gone?

     * Hotspur (Henry Percy). He will, forsooth, have all my prisoners;
       And when I urged the ransom once again 470
       Of my wife's brother, then his cheek look'd pale,
       And on my face he turn'd an eye of death,
       Trembling even at the name of Mortimer.

     * Earl of Worcester. I cannot blame him: was not he proclaim'd
       By Richard that dead is the next of blood? 475

     * Earl of Northumberland. He was; I heard the proclamation:
       And then it was when the unhappy king,
       —Whose wrongs in us God pardon!—did set forth
       Upon his Irish expedition;
       From whence he intercepted did return 480
       To be deposed and shortly murdered.

     * Earl of Worcester. And for whose death we in the world's wide mouth
       Live scandalized and foully spoken of.

     * Hotspur (Henry Percy). But soft, I pray you; did King Richard then
       Proclaim my brother Edmund Mortimer 485
       Heir to the crown?

     * Earl of Northumberland. He did; myself did hear it.

     * Hotspur (Henry Percy). Nay, then I cannot blame his cousin king,
       That wished him on the barren mountains starve.
       But shall it be that you, that set the crown 490
       Upon the head of this forgetful man
       And for his sake wear the detested blot
       Of murderous subornation, shall it be,
       That you a world of curses undergo,
       Being the agents, or base second means, 495
       The cords, the ladder, or the hangman rather?
       O, pardon me that I descend so low,
       To show the line and the predicament
       Wherein you range under this subtle king;
       Shall it for shame be spoken in these days, 500
       Or fill up chronicles in time to come,
       That men of your nobility and power
       Did gage them both in an unjust behalf,
       As both of you—God pardon it!—have done,
       To put down Richard, that sweet lovely rose, 505
       An plant this thorn, this canker, Bolingbroke?
       And shall it in more shame be further spoken,
       That you are fool'd, discarded and shook off
       By him for whom these shames ye underwent?
       No; yet time serves wherein you may redeem 510
       Your banish'd honours and restore yourselves
       Into the good thoughts of the world again,
       Revenge the jeering and disdain'd contempt
       Of this proud king, who studies day and night
       To answer all the debt he owes to you 515
       Even with the bloody payment of your deaths:
       Therefore, I say—

     * Earl of Worcester. Peace, cousin, say no more:
       And now I will unclasp a secret book,
       And to your quick-conceiving discontents 520
       I'll read you matter deep and dangerous,
       As full of peril and adventurous spirit
       As to o'er-walk a current roaring loud
       On the unsteadfast footing of a spear.

     * Hotspur (Henry Percy). If he fall in, good night! or sink or swim:
       525
       Send danger from the east unto the west,
       So honour cross it from the north to south,
       And let them grapple: O, the blood more stirs
       To rouse a lion than to start a hare!

     * Earl of Northumberland. Imagination of some great exploit 530
       Drives him beyond the bounds of patience.

     * Hotspur (Henry Percy). By heaven, methinks it were an easy leap,
       To pluck bright honour from the pale-faced moon,
       Or dive into the bottom of the deep,
       Where fathom-line could never touch the ground, 535
       And pluck up drowned honour by the locks;
       So he that doth redeem her thence might wear
       Without corrival, all her dignities:
       But out upon this half-faced fellowship!

     * Earl of Worcester. He apprehends a world of figures here, 540
       But not the form of what he should attend.
       Good cousin, give me audience for a while.

     * Hotspur (Henry Percy). I cry you mercy.

     * Earl of Worcester. Those same noble Scots
       That are your prisoners,— 545

     * Hotspur (Henry Percy). I'll keep them all;
       By God, he shall not have a Scot of them;
       No, if a Scot would save his soul, he shall not:
       I'll keep them, by this hand.

     * Earl of Worcester. You start away 550
       And lend no ear unto my purposes.
       Those prisoners you shall keep.

     * Hotspur (Henry Percy). Nay, I will; that's flat:
       He said he would not ransom Mortimer;
       Forbad my tongue to speak of Mortimer; 555
       But I will find him when he lies asleep,
       And in his ear I'll holla 'Mortimer!'
       Nay,
       I'll have a starling shall be taught to speak
       Nothing but 'Mortimer,' and give it him 560
       To keep his anger still in motion.

     * Earl of Worcester. Hear you, cousin; a word.

     * Hotspur (Henry Percy). All studies here I solemnly defy,
       Save how to gall and pinch this Bolingbroke:
       And that same sword-and-buckler Prince of Wales, 565
       But that I think his father loves him not
       And would be glad he met with some mischance,
       I would have him poison'd with a pot of ale.

     * Earl of Worcester. Farewell, kinsman: I'll talk to you
       When you are better temper'd to attend. 570

     * Earl of Northumberland. Why, what a wasp-stung and impatient fool
       Art thou to break into this woman's mood,
       Tying thine ear to no tongue but thine own!

     * Hotspur (Henry Percy). Why, look you, I am whipp'd and scourged
       with rods,
       Nettled and stung with pismires, when I hear 575
       Of this vile politician, Bolingbroke.
       In Richard's time,—what do you call the place?—
       A plague upon it, it is in Gloucestershire;
       'Twas where the madcap duke his uncle kept,
       His uncle York; where I first bow'd my knee 580
       Unto this king of smiles, this Bolingbroke,—
       'Sblood!—
       When you and he came back from Ravenspurgh.

     * Earl of Northumberland. At Berkley castle.

     * Hotspur (Henry Percy). You say true: 585
       Why, what a candy deal of courtesy
       This fawning greyhound then did proffer me!
       Look,'when his infant fortune came to age,'
       And 'gentle Harry Percy,' and 'kind cousin;'
       O, the devil take such cozeners! God forgive me! 590
       Good uncle, tell your tale; I have done.

     * Earl of Worcester. Nay, if you have not, to it again;
       We will stay your leisure.

     * Hotspur (Henry Percy). I have done, i' faith.

     * Earl of Worcester. Then once more to your Scottish prisoners. 595
       Deliver them up without their ransom straight,
       And make the Douglas' son your only mean
       For powers in Scotland; which, for divers reasons
       Which I shall send you written, be assured,
       Will easily be granted. You, my lord, 600
       [To Northumberland]
       Your son in Scotland being thus employ'd,
       Shall secretly into the bosom creep
       Of that same noble prelate, well beloved,
       The archbishop. 605

     * Hotspur (Henry Percy). Of York, is it not?

     * Earl of Worcester. True; who bears hard
       His brother's death at Bristol, the Lord Scroop.
       I speak not this in estimation,
       As what I think might be, but what I know 610
       Is ruminated, plotted and set down,
       And only stays but to behold the face
       Of that occasion that shall bring it on.

     * Hotspur (Henry Percy). I smell it: upon my life, it will do well.

     * Earl of Northumberland. Before the game is afoot, thou still let'st
       slip. 615

     * Hotspur (Henry Percy). Why, it cannot choose but be a noble plot;
       And then the power of Scotland and of York,
       To join with Mortimer, ha?

     * Earl of Worcester. And so they shall.

     * Hotspur (Henry Percy). In faith, it is exceedingly well aim'd. 620

     * Earl of Worcester. And 'tis no little reason bids us speed,
       To save our heads by raising of a head;
       For, bear ourselves as even as we can,
       The king will always think him in our debt,
       And think we think ourselves unsatisfied, 625
       Till he hath found a time to pay us home:
       And see already how he doth begin
       To make us strangers to his looks of love.

     * Hotspur (Henry Percy). He does, he does: we'll be revenged on him.

     * Earl of Worcester. Cousin, farewell: no further go in this 630
       Than I by letters shall direct your course.
       When time is ripe, which will be suddenly,
       I'll steal to Glendower and Lord Mortimer;
       Where you and Douglas and our powers at once,
       As I will fashion it, shall happily meet, 635
       To bear our fortunes in our own strong arms,
       Which now we hold at much uncertainty.

     * Earl of Northumberland. Farewell, good brother: we shall thrive, I
       trust.

     * Hotspur (Henry Percy). Uncle, Adieu: O, let the hours be short
       Till fields and blows and groans applaud our sport! 640

   [Exeunt]

   Act II, Scene 1

   Rochester. An inn yard.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   [Enter a Carrier with a lantern in his hand]
     * First Carrier. Heigh-ho! an it be not four by the day, I'll be
       hanged: Charles' wain is over the new chimney, and
       yet our horse not packed. What, ostler! 645

     * Ostler. [Within] Anon, anon.

     * First Carrier. I prithee, Tom, beat Cut's saddle, put a few flocks
       in the point; poor jade, is wrung in the withers out
       of all cess.

   [Enter another Carrier]
     * Second Carrier. Peas and beans are as dank here as a dog, and that
       is the next way to give poor jades the bots: this
       house is turned upside down since Robin Ostler died.

     * First Carrier. Poor fellow, never joyed since the price of oats
       rose; it was the death of him. 655

     * Second Carrier. I think this be the most villanous house in all
       London road for fleas: I am stung like a tench.

     * First Carrier. Like a tench! by the mass, there is ne'er a king
       christen could be better bit than I have been since
       the first cock. 660

     * Second Carrier. Why, they will allow us ne'er a jordan, and then we
       leak in your chimney; and your chamber-lie breeds
       fleas like a loach.

     * First Carrier. What, ostler! come away and be hanged!

     * Second Carrier. I have a gammon of bacon and two razors of ginger,
       665
       to be delivered as far as Charing-cross.

     * First Carrier. God's body! the turkeys in my pannier are quite
       starved. What, ostler! A plague on thee! hast thou
       never an eye in thy head? canst not hear? An
       'twere not as good deed as drink, to break the pate 670
       on thee, I am a very villain. Come, and be hanged!
       hast thou no faith in thee?

   [Enter Gadshill]
     * Gadshill. Good morrow, carriers. What's o'clock?

     * First Carrier. I think it be two o'clock. 675

     * Gadshill. I pray thee lend me thy lantern, to see my gelding
       in the stable.

     * First Carrier. Nay, by God, soft; I know a trick worth two of that,
       i' faith.

     * Gadshill. I pray thee, lend me thine.

     * Second Carrier. Ay, when? can'st tell? Lend me thy lantern, quoth
       680
       he? marry, I'll see thee hanged first.

     * Gadshill. Sirrah carrier, what time do you mean to come to London?

     * Second Carrier. Time enough to go to bed with a candle, I warrant
       thee. Come, neighbour Mugs, we'll call up the
       gentleman: they will along with company, for they 685
       have great charge.

   [Exeunt carriers]
     * Gadshill. What, ho! chamberlain!

     * Chamberlain. [Within] At hand, quoth pick-purse.

     * Gadshill. That's even as fair as—at hand, quoth the 690
       chamberlain; for thou variest no more from picking
       of purses than giving direction doth from labouring;
       thou layest the plot how.

   [Enter Chamberlain]
     * Chamberlain. Good morrow, Master Gadshill. It holds current that
       695
       I told you yesternight: there's a franklin in the
       wild of Kent hath brought three hundred marks with
       him in gold: I heard him tell it to one of his
       company last night at supper; a kind of auditor; one
       that hath abundance of charge too, God knows what. 700
       They are up already, and call for eggs and butter;
       they will away presently.

     * Gadshill. Sirrah, if they meet not with Saint Nicholas'
       clerks, I'll give thee this neck.

     * Chamberlain. No, I'll none of it: I pray thee keep that for the 705
       hangman; for I know thou worshippest St. Nicholas
       as truly as a man of falsehood may.

     * Gadshill. What talkest thou to me of the hangman? if I hang,
       I'll make a fat pair of gallows; for if I hang, old
       Sir John hangs with me, and thou knowest he is no 710
       starveling. Tut! there are other Trojans that thou
       dreamest not of, the which for sport sake are
       content to do the profession some grace; that would,
       if matters should be looked into, for their own
       credit sake, make all whole. I am joined with no 715
       foot-land rakers, no long-staff sixpenny strikers,
       none of these mad mustachio purple-hued malt-worms;
       but with nobility and tranquillity, burgomasters and
       great oneyers, such as can hold in, such as will
       strike sooner than speak, and speak sooner than 720
       drink, and drink sooner than pray: and yet, zounds,
       I lie; for they pray continually to their saint, the
       commonwealth; or rather, not pray to her, but prey
       on her, for they ride up and down on her and make
       her their boots. 725

     * Chamberlain. What, the commonwealth their boots? will she hold
       out water in foul way?

     * Gadshill. She will, she will; justice hath liquored her. We
       steal as in a castle, cocksure; we have the receipt
       of fern-seed, we walk invisible. 730

     * Chamberlain. Nay, by my faith, I think you are more beholding to
       the night than to fern-seed for your walking invisible.

     * Gadshill. Give me thy hand: thou shalt have a share in our
       purchase, as I am a true man.

     * Chamberlain. Nay, rather let me have it, as you are a false thief.
       735

     * Gadshill. Go to; 'homo' is a common name to all men. Bid the
       ostler bring my gelding out of the stable. Farewell,
       you muddy knave.

   [Exeunt]

   Act II, Scene 2

   The highway, near Gadshill.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   [Enter PRINCE HENRY and POINS]
     * Edward Poins. Come, shelter, shelter: I have removed Falstaff's
       horse, and he frets like a gummed velvet.

     * Henry V. Stand close.

   [Enter FALSTAFF]
     * Falstaff. Poins! Poins, and be hanged! Poins! 745

     * Henry V. Peace, ye fat-kidneyed rascal! what a brawling dost
       thou keep!

     * Falstaff. Where's Poins, Hal?

     * Henry V. He is walked up to the top of the hill: I'll go seek him.

     * Falstaff. I am accursed to rob in that thief's company: the 750
       rascal hath removed my horse, and tied him I know
       not where. If I travel but four foot by the squier
       further afoot, I shall break my wind. Well, I doubt
       not but to die a fair death for all this, if I
       'scape hanging for killing that rogue. I have 755
       forsworn his company hourly any time this two and
       twenty years, and yet I am bewitched with the
       rogue's company. If the rascal hath not given me
       medicines to make me love him, I'll be hanged; it
       could not be else: I have drunk medicines. Poins! 760
       Hal! a plague upon you both! Bardolph! Peto!
       I'll starve ere I'll rob a foot further. An 'twere
       not as good a deed as drink, to turn true man and to
       leave these rogues, I am the veriest varlet that
       ever chewed with a tooth. Eight yards of uneven 765
       ground is threescore and ten miles afoot with me;
       and the stony-hearted villains know it well enough:
       a plague upon it when thieves cannot be true one to another!
       [They whistle]
       Whew! A plague upon you all! Give me my horse, you 770
       rogues; give me my horse, and be hanged!

     * Henry V. Peace, ye fat-guts! lie down; lay thine ear close
       to the ground and list if thou canst hear the tread
       of travellers.

     * Falstaff. Have you any levers to lift me up again, being down? 775
       'Sblood, I'll not bear mine own flesh so far afoot
       again for all the coin in thy father's exchequer.
       What a plague mean ye to colt me thus?

     * Henry V. Thou liest; thou art not colted, thou art uncolted.

     * Falstaff. I prithee, good Prince Hal, help me to my horse, 780
       good king's son.

     * Henry V. Out, ye rogue! shall I be your ostler?

     * Falstaff. Go, hang thyself in thine own heir-apparent
       garters! If I be ta'en, I'll peach for this. An I
       have not ballads made on you all and sung to filthy 785
       tunes, let a cup of sack be my poison: when a jest
       is so forward, and afoot too! I hate it.

   [Enter Gadshill, BARDOLPH and PETO]
     * Gadshill. Stand.

     * Falstaff. So I do, against my will. 790

     * Edward Poins. O, 'tis our setter: I know his voice. Bardolph,
       what news?
       money of the king's coming down the hill; 'tis going
       to the king's exchequer.

     * Falstaff. You lie, ye rogue; 'tis going to the king's tavern.

     * Gadshill. There's enough to make us all.

     * Falstaff. To be hanged.

     * Henry V. Sirs, you four shall front them in the narrow lane;
       Ned Poins and I will walk lower: if they 'scape 800
       from your encounter, then they light on us.

     * Peto. How many be there of them?

     * Gadshill. Some eight or ten.

     * Falstaff. 'Zounds, will they not rob us?

     * Henry V. What, a coward, Sir John Paunch? 805

     * Falstaff. Indeed, I am not John of Gaunt, your grandfather;
       but yet no coward, Hal.

     * Henry V. Well, we leave that to the proof.

     * Edward Poins. Sirrah Jack, thy horse stands behind the hedge:
       when thou needest him, there thou shalt find him. 810
       Farewell, and stand fast.

     * Falstaff. Now cannot I strike him, if I should be hanged.

     * Henry V. Ned, where are our disguises?

     * Edward Poins. Here, hard by: stand close.

   [Exeunt PRINCE HENRY and POINS]
     * Falstaff. Now, my masters, happy man be his dole, say I:
       every man to his business.

   [Enter the Travellers]
     * First Traveller. Come, neighbour: the boy shall lead our horses
       down
       the hill; we'll walk afoot awhile, and ease our legs. 820

     * Thieves. Stand!

     * Travellers. Jesus bless us!

     * Falstaff. Strike; down with them; cut the villains' throats:
       ah! whoreson caterpillars! bacon-fed knaves! they
       hate us youth: down with them: fleece them. 825

     * Travellers. O, we are undone, both we and ours for ever!

     * Falstaff. Hang ye, gorbellied knaves, are ye undone? No, ye
       fat chuffs: I would your store were here! On,
       bacons, on! What, ye knaves! young men must live.
       You are Grand-jurors, are ye? we'll jure ye, 'faith. 830

   [Here they rob them and bind them. Exeunt]

   [Re-enter PRINCE HENRY and POINS]
     * Henry V. The thieves have bound the true men. Now could thou
       and I rob the thieves and go merrily to London, it
       would be argument for a week, laughter for a month 835
       and a good jest for ever.

     * Edward Poins. Stand close; I hear them coming.

   [Enter the Thieves again]
     * Falstaff. Come, my masters, let us share, and then to horse
       before day. An the Prince and Poins be not two 840
       arrant cowards, there's no equity stirring: there's
       no more valour in that Poins than in a wild-duck.

     * Henry V. Your money!

     * Edward Poins. Villains!
       [As they are sharing, the Prince and Poins set upon 845
       them; they all run away; and Falstaff, after a blow
       or two, runs away too, leaving the booty behind them]

     * Henry V. Got with much ease. Now merrily to horse:
       The thieves are all scatter'd and possess'd with fear
       So strongly that they dare not meet each other; 850
       Each takes his fellow for an officer.
       Away, good Ned. Falstaff sweats to death,
       And lards the lean earth as he walks along:
       Were 't not for laughing, I should pity him.

     * Edward Poins. How the rogue roar'd! 855

   [Exeunt]

   Act II, Scene 3

   Warkworth castle
   _______________________________________________________________________

   [Enter HOTSPUR, solus, reading a letter]
     * Hotspur (Henry Percy). 'But for mine own part, my lord, I could be
       well
       contented to be there, in respect of the love I bear
       your house.' He could be contented: why is he not, 860
       then? In respect of the love he bears our house:
       he shows in this, he loves his own barn better than
       he loves our house. Let me see some more. 'The
       purpose you undertake is dangerous;'—why, that's
       certain: 'tis dangerous to take a cold, to sleep, to 865
       drink; but I tell you, my lord fool, out of this
       nettle, danger, we pluck this flower, safety. 'The
       purpose you undertake is dangerous; the friends you
       have named uncertain; the time itself unsorted; and
       your whole plot too light for the counterpoise of so 870
       great an opposition.' Say you so, say you so? I say
       unto you again, you are a shallow cowardly hind, and
       you lie. What a lack-brain is this! By the Lord,
       our plot is a good plot as ever was laid; our
       friends true and constant: a good plot, good 875
       friends, and full of expectation; an excellent plot,
       very good friends. What a frosty-spirited rogue is
       this! Why, my lord of York commends the plot and the
       general course of action. 'Zounds, an I were now by
       this rascal, I could brain him with his lady's fan. 880
       Is there not my father, my uncle and myself? lord
       Edmund Mortimer, My lord of York and Owen Glendower?
       is there not besides the Douglas? have I not all
       their letters to meet me in arms by the ninth of the
       next month? and are they not some of them set 885
       forward already? What a pagan rascal is this! an
       infidel! Ha! you shall see now in very sincerity
       of fear and cold heart, will he to the king and lay
       open all our proceedings. O, I could divide myself
       and go to buffets, for moving such a dish of 890
       skim milk with so honourable an action! Hang him!
       let him tell the king: we are prepared. I will set
       forward to-night.
       [Enter LADY PERCY]
       How now, Kate! I must leave you within these two hours. 895

     * Lady Percy. O, my good lord, why are you thus alone?
       For what offence have I this fortnight been
       A banish'd woman from my Harry's bed?
       Tell me, sweet lord, what is't that takes from thee
       Thy stomach, pleasure and thy golden sleep? 900
       Why dost thou bend thine eyes upon the earth,
       And start so often when thou sit'st alone?
       Why hast thou lost the fresh blood in thy cheeks;
       And given my treasures and my rights of thee
       To thick-eyed musing and cursed melancholy? 905
       In thy faint slumbers I by thee have watch'd,
       And heard thee murmur tales of iron wars;
       Speak terms of manage to thy bounding steed;
       Cry 'Courage! to the field!' And thou hast talk'd
       Of sallies and retires, of trenches, tents, 910
       Of palisadoes, frontiers, parapets,
       Of basilisks, of cannon, culverin,
       Of prisoners' ransom and of soldiers slain,
       And all the currents of a heady fight.
       Thy spirit within thee hath been so at war 915
       And thus hath so bestirr'd thee in thy sleep,
       That beads of sweat have stood upon thy brow
       Like bubbles in a late-disturbed stream;
       And in thy face strange motions have appear'd,
       Such as we see when men restrain their breath 920
       On some great sudden hest. O, what portents are these?
       Some heavy business hath my lord in hand,
       And I must know it, else he loves me not.

     * Hotspur (Henry Percy). What, ho!
       [Enter Servant] 925
       Is Gilliams with the packet gone?

     * Servant. He is, my lord, an hour ago.

     * Hotspur (Henry Percy). Hath Butler brought those horses from the
       sheriff?

     * Servant. One horse, my lord, he brought even now.

     * Hotspur (Henry Percy). What horse? a roan, a crop-ear, is it not?
       930

     * Servant. It is, my lord.

     * Hotspur (Henry Percy). That roan shall by my throne.
       Well, I will back him straight: O esperance!
       Bid Butler lead him forth into the park.

   [Exit Servant]
     * Lady Percy. But hear you, my lord.

     * Hotspur (Henry Percy). What say'st thou, my lady?

     * Lady Percy. What is it carries you away?

     * Hotspur (Henry Percy). Why, my horse, my love, my horse.

     * Lady Percy. Out, you mad-headed ape! 940
       A weasel hath not such a deal of spleen
       As you are toss'd with. In faith,
       I'll know your business, Harry, that I will.
       I fear my brother Mortimer doth stir
       About his title, and hath sent for you 945
       To line his enterprise: but if you go,—

     * Hotspur (Henry Percy). So far afoot, I shall be weary, love.

     * Lady Percy. Come, come, you paraquito, answer me
       Directly unto this question that I ask:
       In faith, I'll break thy little finger, Harry, 950
       An if thou wilt not tell me all things true.

     * Hotspur (Henry Percy). Away,
       Away, you trifler! Love! I love thee not,
       I care not for thee, Kate: this is no world
       To play with mammets and to tilt with lips: 955
       We must have bloody noses and crack'd crowns,
       And pass them current too. God's me, my horse!
       What say'st thou, Kate? what would'st thou
       have with me?

     * Lady Percy. Do you not love me? do you not, indeed? 960
       Well, do not then; for since you love me not,
       I will not love myself. Do you not love me?
       Nay, tell me if you speak in jest or no.

     * Hotspur (Henry Percy). Come, wilt thou see me ride?
       And when I am on horseback, I will swear 965
       I love thee infinitely. But hark you, Kate;
       I must not have you henceforth question me
       Whither I go, nor reason whereabout:
       Whither I must, I must; and, to conclude,
       This evening must I leave you, gentle Kate. 970
       I know you wise, but yet no farther wise
       Than Harry Percy's wife: constant you are,
       But yet a woman: and for secrecy,
       No lady closer; for I well believe
       Thou wilt not utter what thou dost not know; 975
       And so far will I trust thee, gentle Kate.

     * Lady Percy. How! so far?

     * Hotspur (Henry Percy). Not an inch further. But hark you, Kate:
       Whither I go, thither shall you go too;
       To-day will I set forth, to-morrow you. 980
       Will this content you, Kate?

     * Lady Percy. It must of force.

   [Exeunt]

   Act II, Scene 4

   The Boar’s-Head Tavern, Eastcheap.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   [Enter PRINCE HENRY and POINS]
     * Henry V. Ned, prithee, come out of that fat room, and lend me 985
       thy hand to laugh a little.

     * Edward Poins. Where hast been, Hal?

     * Henry V. With three or four loggerheads amongst three or four
       score hogsheads. I have sounded the very
       base-string of humility. Sirrah, I am sworn brother 990
       to a leash of drawers; and can call them all by
       their christen names, as Tom, Dick, and Francis.
       They take it already upon their salvation, that
       though I be but the prince of Wales, yet I am king
       of courtesy; and tell me flatly I am no proud Jack, 995
       like Falstaff, but a Corinthian, a lad of mettle, a
       good boy, by the Lord, so they call me, and when I
       am king of England, I shall command all the good
       lads in Eastcheap. They call drinking deep, dyeing
       scarlet; and when you breathe in your watering, they 1000
       cry 'hem!' and bid you play it off. To conclude, I
       am so good a proficient in one quarter of an hour,
       that I can drink with any tinker in his own language
       during my life. I tell thee, Ned, thou hast lost
       much honour, that thou wert not with me in this sweet 1005
       action. But, sweet Ned,—to sweeten which name of
       Ned, I give thee this pennyworth of sugar, clapped
       even now into my hand by an under-skinker, one that
       never spake other English in his life than 'Eight
       shillings and sixpence' and 'You are welcome,' with 1010
       this shrill addition, 'Anon, anon, sir! Score a pint
       of bastard in the Half-Moon,' or so. But, Ned, to
       drive away the time till Falstaff come, I prithee,
       do thou stand in some by-room, while I question my
       puny drawer to what end he gave me the sugar; and do 1015
       thou never leave calling 'Francis,' that his tale
       to me may be nothing but 'Anon.' Step aside, and
       I'll show thee a precedent.

     * Edward Poins. Francis!

     * Henry V. Thou art perfect. 1020

     * Edward Poins. Francis!

   [Exit POINS]

   [Enter FRANCIS]
     * Francis. Anon, anon, sir. Look down into the Pomgarnet, Ralph.

     * Henry V. Come hither, Francis. 1025

     * Francis. My lord?

     * Henry V. How long hast thou to serve, Francis?

     * Francis. Forsooth, five years, and as much as to—

     * Edward Poins. [Within] Francis!

     * Francis. Anon, anon, sir. 1030

     * Henry V. Five year! by'r lady, a long lease for the clinking
       of pewter. But, Francis, darest thou be so valiant
       as to play the coward with thy indenture and show it
       a fair pair of heels and run from it?

     * Francis. O Lord, sir, I'll be sworn upon all the books in 1035
       England, I could find in my heart.

     * Edward Poins. [Within] Francis!

     * Francis. Anon, sir.

     * Henry V. How old art thou, Francis?

     * Francis. Let me see—about Michaelmas next I shall be— 1040

     * Edward Poins. [Within] Francis!

     * Francis. Anon, sir. Pray stay a little, my lord.

     * Henry V. Nay, but hark you, Francis: for the sugar thou
       gavest me,'twas a pennyworth, wast't not?

     * Francis. O Lord, I would it had been two! 1045

     * Henry V. I will give thee for it a thousand pound: ask me
       when thou wilt, and thou shalt have it.

     * Edward Poins. [Within] Francis!

     * Francis. Anon, anon.

     * Henry V. Anon, Francis? No, Francis; but to-morrow, Francis; 1050
       or, Francis, o' Thursday; or indeed, Francis, when
       thou wilt. But, Francis!

     * Francis. My lord?

     * Henry V. Wilt thou rob this leathern jerkin, crystal-button,
       not-pated, agate-ring, puke-stocking, caddis-garter, 1055
       smooth-tongue, Spanish-pouch,—

     * Francis. O Lord, sir, who do you mean?

     * Henry V. Why, then, your brown bastard is your only drink;
       for look you, Francis, your white canvas doublet
       will sully: in Barbary, sir, it cannot come to so much. 1060

     * Francis. What, sir?

     * Edward Poins. [Within] Francis!

     * Henry V. Away, you rogue! dost thou not hear them call?
       [Here they both call him; the drawer stands amazed,
       not knowing which way to go] 1065

   [Enter Vintner]
     * Vintner. What, standest thou still, and hearest such a
       calling? Look to the guests within.
       [Exit Francis]
       My lord, old Sir John, with half-a-dozen more, are 1070
       at the door: shall I let them in?

     * Henry V. Let them alone awhile, and then open the door.
       [Exit Vintner]
       Poins!

   [Re-enter POINS]
     * Edward Poins. Anon, anon, sir.

     * Henry V. Sirrah, Falstaff and the rest of the thieves are at
       the door: shall we be merry?

     * Edward Poins. As merry as crickets, my lad. But hark ye; what
       cunning match have you made with this jest of the 1080
       drawer? come, what's the issue?

     * Henry V. I am now of all humours that have showed themselves
       humours since the old days of goodman Adam to the
       pupil age of this present twelve o'clock at midnight.
       [Re-enter FRANCIS] 1085
       What's o'clock, Francis?

     * Francis. Anon, anon, sir.

   [Exit]
     * Henry V. That ever this fellow should have fewer words than a
       parrot, and yet the son of a woman! His industry is 1090
       upstairs and downstairs; his eloquence the parcel of
       a reckoning. I am not yet of Percy's mind, the
       Hotspur of the north; he that kills me some six or
       seven dozen of Scots at a breakfast, washes his
       hands, and says to his wife 'Fie upon this quiet 1095
       life! I want work.' 'O my sweet Harry,' says she,
       'how many hast thou killed to-day?' 'Give my roan
       horse a drench,' says he; and answers 'Some
       fourteen,' an hour after; 'a trifle, a trifle.' I
       prithee, call in Falstaff: I'll play Percy, and 1100
       that damned brawn shall play Dame Mortimer his
       wife. 'Rivo!' says the drunkard. Call in ribs, call in tallow.

   [Enter FALSTAFF, Gadshill, BARDOLPH, and PETO; FRANCIS following with
   wine]
     * Edward Poins. Welcome, Jack: where hast thou been?

     * Falstaff. A plague of all cowards, I say, and a vengeance too! 1105
       marry, and amen! Give me a cup of sack, boy. Ere I
       lead this life long, I'll sew nether stocks and mend
       them and foot them too. A plague of all cowards!
       Give me a cup of sack, rogue. Is there no virtue extant?

   [He drinks]
     * Henry V. Didst thou never see Titan kiss a dish of butter?
       pitiful-hearted Titan, that melted at the sweet tale
       of the sun's! if thou didst, then behold that compound.

     * Falstaff. You rogue, here's lime in this sack too: there is
       nothing but roguery to be found in villanous man: 1115
       yet a coward is worse than a cup of sack with lime
       in it. A villanous coward! Go thy ways, old Jack;
       die when thou wilt, if manhood, good manhood, be
       not forgot upon the face of the earth, then am I a
       shotten herring. There live not three good men 1120
       unhanged in England; and one of them is fat and
       grows old: God help the while! a bad world, I say.
       I would I were a weaver; I could sing psalms or any
       thing. A plague of all cowards, I say still.

     * Henry V. How now, wool-sack! what mutter you? 1125

     * Falstaff. A king's son! If I do not beat thee out of thy
       kingdom with a dagger of lath, and drive all thy
       subjects afore thee like a flock of wild-geese,
       I'll never wear hair on my face more. You Prince of Wales!

     * Henry V. Why, you whoreson round man, what's the matter? 1130

     * Falstaff. Are not you a coward? answer me to that: and Poins there?

     * Edward Poins. 'Zounds, ye fat paunch, an ye call me coward, by the
       Lord, I'll stab thee.

     * Falstaff. I call thee coward! I'll see thee damned ere I call
       thee coward: but I would give a thousand pound I 1135
       could run as fast as thou canst. You are straight
       enough in the shoulders, you care not who sees your
       back: call you that backing of your friends? A
       plague upon such backing! give me them that will
       face me. Give me a cup of sack: I am a rogue, if I 1140
       drunk to-day.

     * Henry V. O villain! thy lips are scarce wiped since thou
       drunkest last.

     * Falstaff. All's one for that.
       [He drinks] 1145
       A plague of all cowards, still say I.

     * Henry V. What's the matter?

     * Falstaff. What's the matter! there be four of us here have
       ta'en a thousand pound this day morning.

     * Henry V. Where is it, Jack? where is it? 1150

     * Falstaff. Where is it! taken from us it is: a hundred upon
       poor four of us.

     * Henry V. What, a hundred, man?

     * Falstaff. I am a rogue, if I were not at half-sword with a
       dozen of them two hours together. I have 'scaped by 1155
       miracle. I am eight times thrust through the
       doublet, four through the hose; my buckler cut
       through and through; my sword hacked like a
       hand-saw—ecce signum! I never dealt better since
       I was a man: all would not do. A plague of all 1160
       cowards! Let them speak: if they speak more or
       less than truth, they are villains and the sons of darkness.

     * Henry V. Speak, sirs; how was it?

     * Gadshill. We four set upon some dozen—

     * Falstaff. Sixteen at least, my lord. 1165

     * Gadshill. And bound them.

     * Peto. No, no, they were not bound.

     * Falstaff. You rogue, they were bound, every man of them; or I
       am a Jew else, an Ebrew Jew.

     * Gadshill. As we were sharing, some six or seven fresh men set upon
       us— 1170

     * Falstaff. And unbound the rest, and then come in the other.

     * Henry V. What, fought you with them all?

     * Falstaff. All! I know not what you call all; but if I fought
       not with fifty of them, I am a bunch of radish: if
       there were not two or three and fifty upon poor old 1175
       Jack, then am I no two-legged creature.

     * Henry V. Pray God you have not murdered some of them.

     * Falstaff. Nay, that's past praying for: I have peppered two
       of them; two I am sure I have paid, two rogues
       in buckram suits. I tell thee what, Hal, if I tell 1180
       thee a lie, spit in my face, call me horse. Thou
       knowest my old ward; here I lay and thus I bore my
       point. Four rogues in buckram let drive at me—

     * Henry V. What, four? thou saidst but two even now.

     * Falstaff. Four, Hal; I told thee four. 1185

     * Edward Poins. Ay, ay, he said four.

     * Falstaff. These four came all a-front, and mainly thrust at
       me. I made me no more ado but took all their seven
       points in my target, thus.

     * Henry V. Seven? why, there were but four even now. 1190

     * Falstaff. In buckram?

     * Edward Poins. Ay, four, in buckram suits.

     * Falstaff. Seven, by these hilts, or I am a villain else.

     * Henry V. Prithee, let him alone; we shall have more anon.

     * Falstaff. Dost thou hear me, Hal? 1195

     * Henry V. Ay, and mark thee too, Jack.

     * Falstaff. Do so, for it is worth the listening to. These nine
       in buckram that I told thee of—

     * Henry V. So, two more already.

     * Falstaff. Their points being broken,— 1200

     * Edward Poins. Down fell their hose.

     * Falstaff. Began to give me ground: but I followed me close,
       came in foot and hand; and with a thought seven of
       the eleven I paid.

     * Henry V. O monstrous! eleven buckram men grown out of two! 1205

     * Falstaff. But, as the devil would have it, three misbegotten
       knaves in Kendal green came at my back and let drive
       at me; for it was so dark, Hal, that thou couldst
       not see thy hand.

     * Henry V. These lies are like their father that begets them; 1210
       gross as a mountain, open, palpable. Why, thou
       clay-brained guts, thou knotty-pated fool, thou
       whoreson, obscene, grease tallow-catch,—

     * Falstaff. What, art thou mad? art thou mad? is not the truth
       the truth? 1215

     * Henry V. Why, how couldst thou know these men in Kendal
       green, when it was so dark thou couldst not see thy
       hand? come, tell us your reason: what sayest thou to this?

     * Edward Poins. Come, your reason, Jack, your reason.

     * Falstaff. What, upon compulsion? 'Zounds, an I were at the 1220
       strappado, or all the racks in the world, I would
       not tell you on compulsion. Give you a reason on
       compulsion! If reasons were as plentiful as
       blackberries, I would give no man a reason upon
       compulsion, I. 1225

     * Henry V. I'll be no longer guilty of this sin; this sanguine
       coward, this bed-presser, this horseback-breaker,
       this huge hill of flesh,—

     * Falstaff. 'Sblood, you starveling, you elf-skin, you dried
       neat's tongue, you bull's pizzle, you stock-fish! O 1230
       for breath to utter what is like thee! you
       tailor's-yard, you sheath, you bowcase; you vile
       standing-tuck,—

     * Henry V. Well, breathe awhile, and then to it again: and
       when thou hast tired thyself in base comparisons, 1235
       hear me speak but this.

     * Edward Poins. Mark, Jack.

     * Henry V. We two saw you four set on four and bound them, and
       were masters of their wealth. Mark now, how a plain
       tale shall put you down. Then did we two set on you 1240
       four; and, with a word, out-faced you from your
       prize, and have it; yea, and can show it you here in
       the house: and, Falstaff, you carried your guts
       away as nimbly, with as quick dexterity, and roared
       for mercy and still run and roared, as ever I heard 1245
       bull-calf. What a slave art thou, to hack thy sword
       as thou hast done, and then say it was in fight!
       What trick, what device, what starting-hole, canst
       thou now find out to hide thee from this open and
       apparent shame? 1250

     * Edward Poins. Come, let's hear, Jack; what trick hast thou now?

     * Falstaff. By the Lord, I knew ye as well as he that made ye.
       Why, hear you, my masters: was it for me to kill the
       heir-apparent? should I turn upon the true prince?
       why, thou knowest I am as valiant as Hercules: but 1255
       beware instinct; the lion will not touch the true
       prince. Instinct is a great matter; I was now a
       coward on instinct. I shall think the better of
       myself and thee during my life; I for a valiant
       lion, and thou for a true prince. But, by the Lord, 1260
       lads, I am glad you have the money. Hostess, clap
       to the doors: watch to-night, pray to-morrow.
       Gallants, lads, boys, hearts of gold, all the titles
       of good fellowship come to you! What, shall we be
       merry? shall we have a play extempore? 1265

     * Henry V. Content; and the argument shall be thy running away.

     * Falstaff. Ah, no more of that, Hal, an thou lovest me!

   [Enter Hostess]
     * Hostess Quickly. O Jesu, my lord the prince!

     * Henry V. How now, my lady the hostess! what sayest thou to 1270
       me?

     * Hostess Quickly. Marry, my lord, there is a nobleman of the court
       at
       door would speak with you: he says he comes from
       your father.

     * Henry V. Give him as much as will make him a royal man, and 1275
       send him back again to my mother.

     * Falstaff. What manner of man is he?

     * Hostess Quickly. An old man.

     * Falstaff. What doth gravity out of his bed at midnight? Shall
       I give him his answer? 1280

     * Henry V. Prithee, do, Jack.

     * Falstaff. 'Faith, and I'll send him packing.

   [Exit FALSTAFF]
     * Henry V. Now, sirs: by'r lady, you fought fair; so did you,
       Peto; so did you, Bardolph: you are lions too, you 1285
       ran away upon instinct, you will not touch the true
       prince; no, fie!

     * Lord Bardolph. 'Faith, I ran when I saw others run.

     * Henry V. 'Faith, tell me now in earnest, how came Falstaff's
       sword so hacked? 1290

     * Peto. Why, he hacked it with his dagger, and said he would
       swear truth out of England but he would make you
       believe it was done in fight, and persuaded us to do the like.

     * Lord Bardolph. Yea, and to tickle our noses with spear-grass to
       make them bleed, and then to beslubber our garments 1295
       with it and swear it was the blood of true men. I
       did that I did not this seven year before, I blushed
       to hear his monstrous devices.

     * Henry V. O villain, thou stolest a cup of sack eighteen years
       ago, and wert taken with the manner, and ever since 1300
       thou hast blushed extempore. Thou hadst fire and
       sword on thy side, and yet thou rannest away: what
       instinct hadst thou for it?

     * Lord Bardolph. My lord, do you see these meteors? do you behold
       these exhalations? 1305

     * Henry V. I do.

     * Lord Bardolph. What think you they portend?

     * Henry V. Hot livers and cold purses.

     * Lord Bardolph. Choler, my lord, if rightly taken.

     * Henry V. No, if rightly taken, halter. 1310
       [Re-enter FALSTAFF]
       Here comes lean Jack, here comes bare-bone.
       How now, my sweet creature of bombast!
       How long is't ago, Jack, since thou sawest thine own knee?

     * Falstaff. My own knee! when I was about thy years, Hal, I was 1315
       not an eagle's talon in the waist; I could have
       crept into any alderman's thumb-ring: a plague of
       sighing and grief! it blows a man up like a
       bladder. There's villanous news abroad: here was
       Sir John Bracy from your father; you must to the 1320
       court in the morning. That same mad fellow of the
       north, Percy, and he of Wales, that gave Amamon the
       bastinado and made Lucifer cuckold and swore the
       devil his true liegeman upon the cross of a Welsh
       hook—what a plague call you him? 1325

     * Edward Poins. O, Glendower.

     * Falstaff. Owen, Owen, the same; and his son-in-law Mortimer,
       and old Northumberland, and that sprightly Scot of
       Scots, Douglas, that runs o' horseback up a hill
       perpendicular,— 1330

     * Henry V. He that rides at high speed and with his pistol
       kills a sparrow flying.

     * Falstaff. You have hit it.

     * Henry V. So did he never the sparrow.

     * Falstaff. Well, that rascal hath good mettle in him; he will not
       run. 1335

     * Henry V. Why, what a rascal art thou then, to praise him so
       for running!

     * Falstaff. O' horseback, ye cuckoo; but afoot he will not budge a
       foot.

     * Henry V. Yes, Jack, upon instinct.

     * Falstaff. I grant ye, upon instinct. Well, he is there too, 1340
       and one Mordake, and a thousand blue-caps more:
       Worcester is stolen away to-night; thy father's
       beard is turned white with the news: you may buy
       land now as cheap as stinking mackerel.

     * Henry V. Why, then, it is like, if there come a hot June and 1345
       this civil buffeting hold, we shall buy maidenheads
       as they buy hob-nails, by the hundreds.

     * Falstaff. By the mass, lad, thou sayest true; it is like we
       shall have good trading that way. But tell me, Hal,
       art not thou horrible afeard? thou being 1350
       heir-apparent, could the world pick thee out three
       such enemies again as that fiend Douglas, that
       spirit Percy, and that devil Glendower? Art thou
       not horribly afraid? doth not thy blood thrill at
       it? 1355

     * Henry V. Not a whit, i' faith; I lack some of thy instinct.

     * Falstaff. Well, thou wert be horribly chid tomorrow when thou
       comest to thy father: if thou love me, practise an answer.

     * Henry V. Do thou stand for my father, and examine me upon the
       particulars of my life. 1360

     * Falstaff. Shall I? content: this chair shall be my state,
       this dagger my sceptre, and this cushion my crown.

     * Henry V. Thy state is taken for a joined-stool, thy golden
       sceptre for a leaden dagger, and thy precious rich
       crown for a pitiful bald crown! 1365

     * Falstaff. Well, an the fire of grace be not quite out of thee,
       now shalt thou be moved. Give me a cup of sack to
       make my eyes look red, that it may be thought I have
       wept; for I must speak in passion, and I will do it
       in King Cambyses' vein. 1370

     * Henry V. Well, here is my leg.

     * Falstaff. And here is my speech. Stand aside, nobility.

     * Hostess Quickly. O Jesu, this is excellent sport, i' faith!

     * Falstaff. Weep not, sweet queen; for trickling tears are vain.

     * Hostess Quickly. O, the father, how he holds his countenance! 1375

     * Falstaff. For God's sake, lords, convey my tristful queen;
       For tears do stop the flood-gates of her eyes.

     * Hostess Quickly. O Jesu, he doth it as like one of these harlotry
       players as ever I see!

     * Falstaff. Peace, good pint-pot; peace, good tickle-brain. 1380
       Harry, I do not only marvel where thou spendest thy
       time, but also how thou art accompanied: for though
       the camomile, the more it is trodden on the faster
       it grows, yet youth, the more it is wasted the
       sooner it wears. That thou art my son, I have 1385
       partly thy mother's word, partly my own opinion,
       but chiefly a villanous trick of thine eye and a
       foolish-hanging of thy nether lip, that doth warrant
       me. If then thou be son to me, here lies the point;
       why, being son to me, art thou so pointed at? Shall 1390
       the blessed sun of heaven prove a micher and eat
       blackberries? a question not to be asked. Shall
       the sun of England prove a thief and take purses? a
       question to be asked. There is a thing, Harry,
       which thou hast often heard of and it is known to 1395
       many in our land by the name of pitch: this pitch,
       as ancient writers do report, doth defile; so doth
       the company thou keepest: for, Harry, now I do not
       speak to thee in drink but in tears, not in
       pleasure but in passion, not in words only, but in 1400
       woes also: and yet there is a virtuous man whom I
       have often noted in thy company, but I know not his name.

     * Henry V. What manner of man, an it like your majesty?

     * Falstaff. A goodly portly man, i' faith, and a corpulent; of a
       cheerful look, a pleasing eye and a most noble 1405
       carriage; and, as I think, his age some fifty, or,
       by'r lady, inclining to three score; and now I
       remember me, his name is Falstaff: if that man
       should be lewdly given, he deceiveth me; for, Harry,
       I see virtue in his looks. If then the tree may be 1410
       known by the fruit, as the fruit by the tree, then,
       peremptorily I speak it, there is virtue in that
       Falstaff: him keep with, the rest banish. And tell
       me now, thou naughty varlet, tell me, where hast
       thou been this month? 1415

     * Henry V. Dost thou speak like a king? Do thou stand for me,
       and I'll play my father.

     * Falstaff. Depose me? if thou dost it half so gravely, so
       majestically, both in word and matter, hang me up by
       the heels for a rabbit-sucker or a poulter's hare. 1420

     * Henry V. Well, here I am set.

     * Falstaff. And here I stand: judge, my masters.

     * Henry V. Now, Harry, whence come you?

     * Falstaff. My noble lord, from Eastcheap.

     * Henry V. The complaints I hear of thee are grievous. 1425

     * Falstaff. 'Sblood, my lord, they are false: nay, I'll tickle
       ye for a young prince, i' faith.

     * Henry V. Swearest thou, ungracious boy? henceforth ne'er look
       on me. Thou art violently carried away from grace:
       there is a devil haunts thee in the likeness of an 1430
       old fat man; a tun of man is thy companion. Why
       dost thou converse with that trunk of humours, that
       bolting-hutch of beastliness, that swollen parcel
       of dropsies, that huge bombard of sack, that stuffed
       cloak-bag of guts, that roasted Manningtree ox with 1435
       the pudding in his belly, that reverend vice, that
       grey iniquity, that father ruffian, that vanity in
       years? Wherein is he good, but to taste sack and
       drink it? wherein neat and cleanly, but to carve a
       capon and eat it? wherein cunning, but in craft? 1440
       wherein crafty, but in villany? wherein villanous,
       but in all things? wherein worthy, but in nothing?

     * Falstaff. I would your grace would take me with you: whom
       means your grace?

     * Henry V. That villanous abominable misleader of youth, 1445
       Falstaff, that old white-bearded Satan.

     * Falstaff. My lord, the man I know.

     * Henry V. I know thou dost.

     * Falstaff. But to say I know more harm in him than in myself,
       were to say more than I know. That he is old, the 1450
       more the pity, his white hairs do witness it; but
       that he is, saving your reverence, a whoremaster,
       that I utterly deny. If sack and sugar be a fault,
       God help the wicked! if to be old and merry be a
       sin, then many an old host that I know is damned: if 1455
       to be fat be to be hated, then Pharaoh's lean kine
       are to be loved. No, my good lord; banish Peto,
       banish Bardolph, banish Poins: but for sweet Jack
       Falstaff, kind Jack Falstaff, true Jack Falstaff,
       valiant Jack Falstaff, and therefore more valiant, 1460
       being, as he is, old Jack Falstaff, banish not him
       thy Harry's company, banish not him thy Harry's
       company: banish plump Jack, and banish all the world.

     * Henry V. I do, I will.

   [A knocking heard]

   [Exeunt Hostess, FRANCIS, and BARDOLPH]

   [Re-enter BARDOLPH, running]
     * Lord Bardolph. O, my lord, my lord! the sheriff with a most
       monstrous watch is at the door.

     * Falstaff. Out, ye rogue! Play out the play: I have much to 1470
       say in the behalf of that Falstaff.

   [Re-enter the Hostess]
     * Hostess Quickly. O Jesu, my lord, my lord!

     * Henry V. Heigh, heigh! the devil rides upon a fiddlestick:
       what's the matter? 1475

     * Hostess Quickly. The sheriff and all the watch are at the door:
       they
       are come to search the house. Shall I let them in?

     * Falstaff. Dost thou hear, Hal? never call a true piece of
       gold a counterfeit: thou art essentially mad,
       without seeming so. 1480

     * Henry V. And thou a natural coward, without instinct.

     * Falstaff. I deny your major: if you will deny the sheriff,
       so; if not, let him enter: if I become not a cart
       as well as another man, a plague on my bringing up!
       I hope I shall as soon be strangled with a halter as another. 1485

     * Henry V. Go, hide thee behind the arras: the rest walk up
       above. Now, my masters, for a true face and good
       conscience.

     * Falstaff. Both which I have had: but their date is out, and
       therefore I'll hide me. 1490

     * Henry V. Call in the sheriff.
       [Exeunt all except PRINCE HENRY and PETO]
       [Enter Sheriff and the Carrier]
       Now, master sheriff, what is your will with me?

     * Sheriff. First, pardon me, my lord. A hue and cry 1495
       Hath follow'd certain men unto this house.

     * Henry V. What men?

     * Sheriff. One of them is well known, my gracious lord,
       A gross fat man.

     * Carrier. As fat as butter. 1500

     * Henry V. The man, I do assure you, is not here;
       For I myself at this time have employ'd him.
       And, sheriff, I will engage my word to thee
       That I will, by to-morrow dinner-time,
       Send him to answer thee, or any man, 1505
       For any thing he shall be charged withal:
       And so let me entreat you leave the house.

     * Sheriff. I will, my lord. There are two gentlemen
       Have in this robbery lost three hundred marks.

     * Henry V. It may be so: if he have robb'd these men, 1510
       He shall be answerable; and so farewell.

     * Sheriff. Good night, my noble lord.

     * Henry V. I think it is good morrow, is it not?

     * Sheriff. Indeed, my lord, I think it be two o'clock.

   [Exeunt Sheriff and Carrier]
     * Henry V. This oily rascal is known as well as Paul's. Go,
       call him forth.

     * Peto. Falstaff!—Fast asleep behind the arras, and
       snorting like a horse.

     * Henry V. Hark, how hard he fetches breath. Search his pockets. 1520
       [He searcheth his pockets, and findeth certain papers]
       What hast thou found?

     * Peto. Nothing but papers, my lord.

     * Henry V. Let's see what they be: read them.

     * Peto. [Reads] Item, A capon,. . 2s. 2d. 1525
       Item, Sauce,. . . 4d.
       Item, Sack, two gallons, 5s. 8d.
       Item, Anchovies and sack after supper, 2s. 6d.
       Item, Bread, ob.

     * Henry V. O monstrous! but one half-penny-worth of bread to 1530
       this intolerable deal of sack! What there is else,
       keep close; we'll read it at more advantage: there
       let him sleep till day. I'll to the court in the
       morning. We must all to the wars, and thy place
       shall be honourable. I'll procure this fat rogue a 1535
       charge of foot; and I know his death will be a
       march of twelve-score. The money shall be paid
       back again with advantage. Be with me betimes in
       the morning; and so, good morrow, Peto.

   [Exeunt]
     * Peto. Good morrow, good my lord.

   Act III, Scene 1

   Bangor. The Archdeacon’s house.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   [Enter HOTSPUR, WORCESTER, MORTIMER, and GLENDOWER]
     * Mortimer. These promises are fair, the parties sure,
       And our induction full of prosperous hope.

     * Hotspur (Henry Percy). Lord Mortimer, and cousin Glendower, 1545
       Will you sit down?
       And uncle Worcester: a plague upon it!
       I have forgot the map.

     * Glendower. No, here it is.
       Sit, cousin Percy; sit, good cousin Hotspur, 1550
       For by that name as oft as Lancaster
       Doth speak of you, his cheek looks pale and with
       A rising sigh he wisheth you in heaven.

     * Hotspur (Henry Percy). And you in hell, as oft as he hears Owen
       Glendower spoke of.

     * Glendower. I cannot blame him: at my nativity 1555
       The front of heaven was full of fiery shapes,
       Of burning cressets; and at my birth
       The frame and huge foundation of the earth
       Shaked like a coward.

     * Hotspur (Henry Percy). Why, so it would have done at the same
       season, if 1560
       your mother's cat had but kittened, though yourself
       had never been born.

     * Glendower. I say the earth did shake when I was born.

     * Hotspur (Henry Percy). And I say the earth was not of my mind,
       If you suppose as fearing you it shook. 1565

     * Glendower. The heavens were all on fire, the earth did tremble.

     * Hotspur (Henry Percy). O, then the earth shook to see the heavens
       on fire,
       And not in fear of your nativity.
       Diseased nature oftentimes breaks forth
       In strange eruptions; oft the teeming earth 1570
       Is with a kind of colic pinch'd and vex'd
       By the imprisoning of unruly wind
       Within her womb; which, for enlargement striving,
       Shakes the old beldam earth and topples down
       Steeples and moss-grown towers. At your birth 1575
       Our grandam earth, having this distemperature,
       In passion shook.

     * Glendower. Cousin, of many men
       I do not bear these crossings. Give me leave
       To tell you once again that at my birth 1580
       The front of heaven was full of fiery shapes,
       The goats ran from the mountains, and the herds
       Were strangely clamorous to the frighted fields.
       These signs have mark'd me extraordinary;
       And all the courses of my life do show 1585
       I am not in the roll of common men.
       Where is he living, clipp'd in with the sea
       That chides the banks of England, Scotland, Wales,
       Which calls me pupil, or hath read to me?
       And bring him out that is but woman's son 1590
       Can trace me in the tedious ways of art
       And hold me pace in deep experiments.

     * Hotspur (Henry Percy). I think there's no man speaks better Welsh.
       I'll to dinner.

     * Mortimer. Peace, cousin Percy; you will make him mad. 1595

     * Glendower. I can call spirits from the vasty deep.

     * Hotspur (Henry Percy). Why, so can I, or so can any man;
       But will they come when you do call for them?

     * Glendower. Why, I can teach you, cousin, to command
       The devil. 1600

     * Hotspur (Henry Percy). And I can teach thee, coz, to shame the
       devil
       By telling truth: tell truth and shame the devil.
       If thou have power to raise him, bring him hither,
       And I'll be sworn I have power to shame him hence.
       O, while you live, tell truth and shame the devil! 1605

     * Mortimer. Come, come, no more of this unprofitable chat.

     * Glendower. Three times hath Henry Bolingbroke made head
       Against my power; thrice from the banks of Wye
       And sandy-bottom'd Severn have I sent him
       Bootless home and weather-beaten back. 1610

     * Hotspur (Henry Percy). Home without boots, and in foul weather too!
       How 'scapes he agues, in the devil's name?

     * Glendower. Come, here's the map: shall we divide our right
       According to our threefold order ta'en?

     * Mortimer. The archdeacon hath divided it 1615
       Into three limits very equally:
       England, from Trent and Severn hitherto,
       By south and east is to my part assign'd:
       All westward, Wales beyond the Severn shore,
       And all the fertile land within that bound, 1620
       To Owen Glendower: and, dear coz, to you
       The remnant northward, lying off from Trent.
       And our indentures tripartite are drawn;
       Which being sealed interchangeably,
       A business that this night may execute, 1625
       To-morrow, cousin Percy, you and I
       And my good Lord of Worcester will set forth
       To meet your father and the Scottish power,
       As is appointed us, at Shrewsbury.
       My father Glendower is not ready yet, 1630
       Not shall we need his help these fourteen days.
       Within that space you may have drawn together
       Your tenants, friends and neighbouring gentlemen.

     * Glendower. A shorter time shall send me to you, lords:
       And in my conduct shall your ladies come; 1635
       From whom you now must steal and take no leave,
       For there will be a world of water shed
       Upon the parting of your wives and you.

     * Hotspur (Henry Percy). Methinks my moiety, north from Burton here,
       In quantity equals not one of yours: 1640
       See how this river comes me cranking in,
       And cuts me from the best of all my land
       A huge half-moon, a monstrous cantle out.
       I'll have the current in this place damm'd up;
       And here the smug and silver Trent shall run 1645
       In a new channel, fair and evenly;
       It shall not wind with such a deep indent,
       To rob me of so rich a bottom here.

     * Glendower. Not wind? it shall, it must; you see it doth.

     * Mortimer. Yea, but 1650
       Mark how he bears his course, and runs me up
       With like advantage on the other side;
       Gelding the opposed continent as much
       As on the other side it takes from you.

     * Earl of Worcester. Yea, but a little charge will trench him here
       1655
       And on this north side win this cape of land;
       And then he runs straight and even.

     * Hotspur (Henry Percy). I'll have it so: a little charge will do it.

     * Glendower. I'll not have it alter'd.

     * Hotspur (Henry Percy). Will not you? 1660

     * Glendower. No, nor you shall not.

     * Hotspur (Henry Percy). Who shall say me nay?

     * Glendower. Why, that will I.

     * Hotspur (Henry Percy). Let me not understand you, then; speak it in
       Welsh.

     * Glendower. I can speak English, lord, as well as you; 1665
       For I was train'd up in the English court;
       Where, being but young, I framed to the harp
       Many an English ditty lovely well
       And gave the tongue a helpful ornament,
       A virtue that was never seen in you. 1670

     * Hotspur (Henry Percy). Marry,
       And I am glad of it with all my heart:
       I had rather be a kitten and cry mew
       Than one of these same metre ballad-mongers;
       I had rather hear a brazen canstick turn'd, 1675
       Or a dry wheel grate on the axle-tree;
       And that would set my teeth nothing on edge,
       Nothing so much as mincing poetry:
       'Tis like the forced gait of a shuffling nag.

     * Glendower. Come, you shall have Trent turn'd. 1680

     * Hotspur (Henry Percy). I do not care: I'll give thrice so much land
       To any well-deserving friend;
       But in the way of bargain, mark ye me,
       I'll cavil on the ninth part of a hair.
       Are the indentures drawn? shall we be gone? 1685

     * Glendower. The moon shines fair; you may away by night:
       I'll haste the writer and withal
       Break with your wives of your departure hence:
       I am afraid my daughter will run mad,
       So much she doteth on her Mortimer. 1690

   [Exit GLENDOWER]
     * Mortimer. Fie, cousin Percy! how you cross my father!

     * Hotspur (Henry Percy). I cannot choose: sometime he angers me
       With telling me of the mouldwarp and the ant,
       Of the dreamer Merlin and his prophecies, 1695
       And of a dragon and a finless fish,
       A clip-wing'd griffin and a moulten raven,
       A couching lion and a ramping cat,
       And such a deal of skimble-skamble stuff
       As puts me from my faith. I tell you what; 1700
       He held me last night at least nine hours
       In reckoning up the several devils' names
       That were his lackeys: I cried 'hum,' and 'well, go to,'
       But mark'd him not a word. O, he is as tedious
       As a tired horse, a railing wife; 1705
       Worse than a smoky house: I had rather live
       With cheese and garlic in a windmill, far,
       Than feed on cates and have him talk to me
       In any summer-house in Christendom.

     * Mortimer. In faith, he is a worthy gentleman, 1710
       Exceedingly well read, and profited
       In strange concealments, valiant as a lion
       And as wondrous affable and as bountiful
       As mines of India. Shall I tell you, cousin?
       He holds your temper in a high respect 1715
       And curbs himself even of his natural scope
       When you come 'cross his humour; faith, he does:
       I warrant you, that man is not alive
       Might so have tempted him as you have done,
       Without the taste of danger and reproof: 1720
       But do not use it oft, let me entreat you.

     * Earl of Worcester. In faith, my lord, you are too wilful-blame;
       And since your coming hither have done enough
       To put him quite beside his patience.
       You must needs learn, lord, to amend this fault: 1725
       Though sometimes it show greatness, courage, blood,—
       And that's the dearest grace it renders you,—
       Yet oftentimes it doth present harsh rage,
       Defect of manners, want of government,
       Pride, haughtiness, opinion and disdain: 1730
       The least of which haunting a nobleman
       Loseth men's hearts and leaves behind a stain
       Upon the beauty of all parts besides,
       Beguiling them of commendation.

     * Hotspur (Henry Percy). Well, I am school'd: good manners be your
       speed! 1735
       Here come our wives, and let us take our leave.

   [Re-enter GLENDOWER with the ladies]
     * Mortimer. This is the deadly spite that angers me;
       My wife can speak no English, I no Welsh.

     * Glendower. My daughter weeps: she will not part with you; 1740
       She'll be a soldier too, she'll to the wars.

     * Mortimer. Good father, tell her that she and my aunt Percy
       Shall follow in your conduct speedily.

   [Glendower speaks to her in Welsh, and she answers him in the same]
     * Glendower. She is desperate here; a peevish self-wind harlotry,
       1745
       one that no persuasion can do good upon.

   [The lady speaks in Welsh]
     * Mortimer. I understand thy looks: that pretty Welsh
       Which thou pour'st down from these swelling heavens
       I am too perfect in; and, but for shame, 1750
       In such a parley should I answer thee.
       [The lady speaks again in Welsh]
       I understand thy kisses and thou mine,
       And that's a feeling disputation:
       But I will never be a truant, love, 1755
       Till I have learned thy language; for thy tongue
       Makes Welsh as sweet as ditties highly penn'd,
       Sung by a fair queen in a summer's bower,
       With ravishing division, to her lute.

     * Glendower. Nay, if you melt, then will she run mad. 1760

   [The lady speaks again in Welsh]
     * Mortimer. O, I am ignorance itself in this!

     * Glendower. She bids you on the wanton rushes lay you down
       And rest your gentle head upon her lap,
       And she will sing the song that pleaseth you 1765
       And on your eyelids crown the god of sleep.
       Charming your blood with pleasing heaviness,
       Making such difference 'twixt wake and sleep
       As is the difference betwixt day and night
       The hour before the heavenly-harness'd team 1770
       Begins his golden progress in the east.

     * Mortimer. With all my heart I'll sit and hear her sing:
       By that time will our book, I think, be drawn

     * Glendower. Do so;
       And those musicians that shall play to you 1775
       Hang in the air a thousand leagues from hence,
       And straight they shall be here: sit, and attend.

     * Hotspur (Henry Percy). Come, Kate, thou art perfect in lying down:
       come,
       quick, quick, that I may lay my head in thy lap.

     * Lady Percy. Go, ye giddy goose. 1780

   [The music plays]
     * Hotspur (Henry Percy). Now I perceive the devil understands Welsh;
       And 'tis no marvel he is so humorous.
       By'r lady, he is a good musician.

     * Lady Percy. Then should you be nothing but musical for you are 1785
       altogether governed by humours. Lie still, ye thief,
       and hear the lady sing in Welsh.

     * Hotspur (Henry Percy). I had rather hear Lady, my brach, howl in
       Irish.

     * Lady Percy. Wouldst thou have thy head broken?

     * Hotspur (Henry Percy). No. 1790

     * Lady Percy. Then be still.

     * Hotspur (Henry Percy). Neither;'tis a woman's fault.

     * Lady Percy. Now God help thee!

     * Hotspur (Henry Percy). To the Welsh lady's bed.

     * Lady Percy. What's that? 1795

     * Hotspur (Henry Percy). Peace! she sings.

   [Here the lady sings a Welsh song]
     * Hotspur (Henry Percy). Come, Kate, I'll have your song too.

     * Lady Percy. Not mine, in good sooth.

     * Hotspur (Henry Percy). Not yours, in good sooth! Heart! you swear
       like a 1800
       comfit-maker's wife. 'Not you, in good sooth,' and
       'as true as I live,' and 'as God shall mend me,' and
       'as sure as day,'
       And givest such sarcenet surety for thy oaths,
       As if thou never walk'st further than Finsbury. 1805
       Swear me, Kate, like a lady as thou art,
       A good mouth-filling oath, and leave 'in sooth,'
       And such protest of pepper-gingerbread,
       To velvet-guards and Sunday-citizens.
       Come, sing. 1810

     * Lady Percy. I will not sing.

     * Hotspur (Henry Percy). 'Tis the next way to turn tailor, or be
       red-breast
       teacher. An the indentures be drawn, I'll away
       within these two hours; and so, come in when ye will.

   [Exit]
     * Glendower. Come, come, Lord Mortimer; you are as slow
       As hot Lord Percy is on fire to go.
       By this our book is drawn; we'll but seal,
       And then to horse immediately.

     * Mortimer. With all my heart. 1820

   [Exeunt]

   Act III, Scene 2

   London. The palace.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   [Enter KING HENRY IV, PRINCE HENRY, and others]
     * Henry IV. Lords, give us leave; the Prince of Wales and I
       Must have some private conference; but be near at hand,
       For we shall presently have need of you. 1825
       [Exeunt Lords]
       I know not whether God will have it so,
       For some displeasing service I have done,
       That, in his secret doom, out of my blood
       He'll breed revengement and a scourge for me; 1830
       But thou dost in thy passages of life
       Make me believe that thou art only mark'd
       For the hot vengeance and the rod of heaven
       To punish my mistreadings. Tell me else,
       Could such inordinate and low desires, 1835
       Such poor, such bare, such lewd, such mean attempts,
       Such barren pleasures, rude society,
       As thou art match'd withal and grafted to,
       Accompany the greatness of thy blood
       And hold their level with thy princely heart? 1840

     * Henry V. So please your majesty, I would I could
       Quit all offences with as clear excuse
       As well as I am doubtless I can purge
       Myself of many I am charged withal:
       Yet such extenuation let me beg, 1845
       As, in reproof of many tales devised,
       which oft the ear of greatness needs must hear,
       By smiling pick-thanks and base news-mongers,
       I may, for some things true, wherein my youth
       Hath faulty wander'd and irregular, 1850
       Find pardon on my true submission.

     * Henry IV. God pardon thee! yet let me wonder, Harry,
       At thy affections, which do hold a wing
       Quite from the flight of all thy ancestors.
       Thy place in council thou hast rudely lost. 1855
       Which by thy younger brother is supplied,
       And art almost an alien to the hearts
       Of all the court and princes of my blood:
       The hope and expectation of thy time
       Is ruin'd, and the soul of every man 1860
       Prophetically doth forethink thy fall.
       Had I so lavish of my presence been,
       So common-hackney'd in the eyes of men,
       So stale and cheap to vulgar company,
       Opinion, that did help me to the crown, 1865
       Had still kept loyal to possession
       And left me in reputeless banishment,
       A fellow of no mark nor likelihood.
       By being seldom seen, I could not stir
       But like a comet I was wonder'd at; 1870
       That men would tell their children 'This is he;'
       Others would say 'Where, which is Bolingbroke?'
       And then I stole all courtesy from heaven,
       And dress'd myself in such humility
       That I did pluck allegiance from men's hearts, 1875
       Loud shouts and salutations from their mouths,
       Even in the presence of the crowned king.
       Thus did I keep my person fresh and new;
       My presence, like a robe pontifical,
       Ne'er seen but wonder'd at: and so my state, 1880
       Seldom but sumptuous, showed like a feast
       And won by rareness such solemnity.
       The skipping king, he ambled up and down
       With shallow jesters and rash bavin wits,
       Soon kindled and soon burnt; carded his state, 1885
       Mingled his royalty with capering fools,
       Had his great name profaned with their scorns
       And gave his countenance, against his name,
       To laugh at gibing boys and stand the push
       Of every beardless vain comparative, 1890
       Grew a companion to the common streets,
       Enfeoff'd himself to popularity;
       That, being daily swallow'd by men's eyes,
       They surfeited with honey and began
       To loathe the taste of sweetness, whereof a little 1895
       More than a little is by much too much.
       So when he had occasion to be seen,
       He was but as the cuckoo is in June,
       Heard, not regarded; seen, but with such eyes
       As, sick and blunted with community, 1900
       Afford no extraordinary gaze,
       Such as is bent on sun-like majesty
       When it shines seldom in admiring eyes;
       But rather drowzed and hung their eyelids down,
       Slept in his face and render'd such aspect 1905
       As cloudy men use to their adversaries,
       Being with his presence glutted, gorged and full.
       And in that very line, Harry, standest thou;
       For thou has lost thy princely privilege
       With vile participation: not an eye 1910
       But is a-weary of thy common sight,
       Save mine, which hath desired to see thee more;
       Which now doth that I would not have it do,
       Make blind itself with foolish tenderness.

     * Henry V. I shall hereafter, my thrice gracious lord, 1915
       Be more myself.

     * Henry IV. For all the world
       As thou art to this hour was Richard then
       When I from France set foot at Ravenspurgh,
       And even as I was then is Percy now. 1920
       Now, by my sceptre and my soul to boot,
       He hath more worthy interest to the state
       Than thou the shadow of succession;
       For of no right, nor colour like to right,
       He doth fill fields with harness in the realm, 1925
       Turns head against the lion's armed jaws,
       And, being no more in debt to years than thou,
       Leads ancient lords and reverend bishops on
       To bloody battles and to bruising arms.
       What never-dying honour hath he got 1930
       Against renowned Douglas! whose high deeds,
       Whose hot incursions and great name in arms
       Holds from all soldiers chief majority
       And military title capital
       Through all the kingdoms that acknowledge Christ: 1935
       Thrice hath this Hotspur, Mars in swathling clothes,
       This infant warrior, in his enterprises
       Discomfited great Douglas, ta'en him once,
       Enlarged him and made a friend of him,
       To fill the mouth of deep defiance up 1940
       And shake the peace and safety of our throne.
       And what say you to this? Percy, Northumberland,
       The Archbishop's grace of York, Douglas, Mortimer,
       Capitulate against us and are up.
       But wherefore do I tell these news to thee? 1945
       Why, Harry, do I tell thee of my foes,
       Which art my near'st and dearest enemy?
       Thou that art like enough, through vassal fear,
       Base inclination and the start of spleen
       To fight against me under Percy's pay, 1950
       To dog his heels and curtsy at his frowns,
       To show how much thou art degenerate.

     * Henry V. Do not think so; you shall not find it so:
       And God forgive them that so much have sway'd
       Your majesty's good thoughts away from me! 1955
       I will redeem all this on Percy's head
       And in the closing of some glorious day
       Be bold to tell you that I am your son;
       When I will wear a garment all of blood
       And stain my favours in a bloody mask, 1960
       Which, wash'd away, shall scour my shame with it:
       And that shall be the day, whene'er it lights,
       That this same child of honour and renown,
       This gallant Hotspur, this all-praised knight,
       And your unthought-of Harry chance to meet. 1965
       For every honour sitting on his helm,
       Would they were multitudes, and on my head
       My shames redoubled! for the time will come,
       That I shall make this northern youth exchange
       His glorious deeds for my indignities. 1970
       Percy is but my factor, good my lord,
       To engross up glorious deeds on my behalf;
       And I will call him to so strict account,
       That he shall render every glory up,
       Yea, even the slightest worship of his time, 1975
       Or I will tear the reckoning from his heart.
       This, in the name of God, I promise here:
       The which if He be pleased I shall perform,
       I do beseech your majesty may salve
       The long-grown wounds of my intemperance: 1980
       If not, the end of life cancels all bands;
       And I will die a hundred thousand deaths
       Ere break the smallest parcel of this vow.

     * Henry IV. A hundred thousand rebels die in this:
       Thou shalt have charge and sovereign trust herein. 1985
       [Enter BLUNT]
       How now, good Blunt? thy looks are full of speed.

     * Blunt. So hath the business that I come to speak of.
       Lord Mortimer of Scotland hath sent word
       That Douglas and the English rebels met 1990
       The eleventh of this month at Shrewsbury
       A mighty and a fearful head they are,
       If promises be kept on every hand,
       As ever offer'd foul play in the state.

     * Henry IV. The Earl of Westmoreland set forth to-day; 1995
       With him my son, Lord John of Lancaster;
       For this advertisement is five days old:
       On Wednesday next, Harry, you shall set forward;
       On Thursday we ourselves will march: our meeting
       Is Bridgenorth: and, Harry, you shall march 2000
       Through Gloucestershire; by which account,
       Our business valued, some twelve days hence
       Our general forces at Bridgenorth shall meet.
       Our hands are full of business: let's away;
       Advantage feeds him fat, while men delay. 2005

   Act III, Scene 3

   Eastcheap. The Boar’s-Head Tavern.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   [Enter FALSTAFF and BARDOLPH]
     * Falstaff. Bardolph, am I not fallen away vilely since this last
       action? do I not bate? do I not dwindle? Why my
       skin hangs about me like an like an old lady's loose 2010
       gown; I am withered like an old apple-john. Well,
       I'll repent, and that suddenly, while I am in some
       liking; I shall be out of heart shortly, and then I
       shall have no strength to repent. An I have not
       forgotten what the inside of a church is made of, I 2015
       am a peppercorn, a brewer's horse: the inside of a
       church! Company, villanous company, hath been the
       spoil of me.

     * Lord Bardolph. Sir John, you are so fretful, you cannot live long.

     * Falstaff. Why, there is it: come sing me a bawdy song; make 2020
       me merry. I was as virtuously given as a gentleman
       need to be; virtuous enough; swore little; diced not
       above seven times a week; went to a bawdy-house once
       in a quarter—of an hour; paid money that I
       borrowed, three of four times; lived well and in 2025
       good compass: and now I live out of all order, out
       of all compass.

     * Lord Bardolph. Why, you are so fat, Sir John, that you must needs
       be out of all compass, out of all reasonable
       compass, Sir John. 2030

     * Falstaff. Do thou amend thy face, and I'll amend my life:
       thou art our admiral, thou bearest the lantern in
       the poop, but 'tis in the nose of thee; thou art the
       Knight of the Burning Lamp.

     * Lord Bardolph. Why, Sir John, my face does you no harm. 2035

     * Falstaff. No, I'll be sworn; I make as good use of it as many
       a man doth of a Death's-head or a memento mori: I
       never see thy face but I think upon hell-fire and
       Dives that lived in purple; for there he is in his
       robes, burning, burning. If thou wert any way 2040
       given to virtue, I would swear by thy face; my oath
       should be 'By this fire, that's God's angel:' but
       thou art altogether given over; and wert indeed, but
       for the light in thy face, the son of utter
       darkness. When thou rannest up Gadshill in the 2045
       night to catch my horse, if I did not think thou
       hadst been an ignis fatuus or a ball of wildfire,
       there's no purchase in money. O, thou art a
       perpetual triumph, an everlasting bonfire-light!
       Thou hast saved me a thousand marks in links and 2050
       torches, walking with thee in the night betwixt
       tavern and tavern: but the sack that thou hast
       drunk me would have bought me lights as good cheap
       at the dearest chandler's in Europe. I have
       maintained that salamander of yours with fire any 2055
       time this two and thirty years; God reward me for
       it!

     * Lord Bardolph. 'Sblood, I would my face were in your belly!

     * Falstaff. God-a-mercy! so should I be sure to be heart-burned.
       [Enter Hostess] 2060
       How now, Dame Partlet the hen! have you inquired
       yet who picked my pocket?

     * Hostess Quickly. Why, Sir John, what do you think, Sir John? do you
       think I keep thieves in my house? I have searched,
       I have inquired, so has my husband, man by man, boy 2065
       by boy, servant by servant: the tithe of a hair
       was never lost in my house before.

     * Falstaff. Ye lie, hostess: Bardolph was shaved and lost many
       a hair; and I'll be sworn my pocket was picked. Go
       to, you are a woman, go. 2070

     * Hostess Quickly. Who, I? no; I defy thee: God's light, I was never
       called so in mine own house before.

     * Falstaff. Go to, I know you well enough.

     * Hostess Quickly. No, Sir John; You do not know me, Sir John. I know
       you, Sir John: you owe me money, Sir John; and now 2075
       you pick a quarrel to beguile me of it: I bought
       you a dozen of shirts to your back.

     * Falstaff. Dowlas, filthy dowlas: I have given them away to
       bakers' wives, and they have made bolters of them.

     * Hostess Quickly. Now, as I am a true woman, holland of eight 2080
       shillings an ell. You owe money here besides, Sir
       John, for your diet and by-drinkings, and money lent
       you, four and twenty pound.

     * Falstaff. He had his part of it; let him pay.

     * Hostess Quickly. He? alas, he is poor; he hath nothing. 2085

     * Falstaff. How! poor? look upon his face; what call you rich?
       let them coin his nose, let them coin his cheeks:
       Ill not pay a denier. What, will you make a younker
       of me? shall I not take mine case in mine inn but I
       shall have my pocket picked? I have lost a 2090
       seal-ring of my grandfather's worth forty mark.

     * Hostess Quickly. O Jesu, I have heard the prince tell him, I know
       not
       how oft, that ring was copper!

     * Falstaff. How! the prince is a Jack, a sneak-cup: 'sblood, an
       he were here, I would cudgel him like a dog, if he 2095
       would say so.
       [Enter PRINCE HENRY and PETO, marching, and FALSTAFF
       meets them playing on his truncheon like a life]
       How now, lad! is the wind in that door, i' faith?
       must we all march? 2100

     * Lord Bardolph. Yea, two and two, Newgate fashion.

     * Hostess Quickly. My lord, I pray you, hear me.

     * Henry V. What sayest thou, Mistress Quickly? How doth thy
       husband? I love him well; he is an honest man.

     * Hostess Quickly. Good my lord, hear me. 2105

     * Falstaff. Prithee, let her alone, and list to me.

     * Henry V. What sayest thou, Jack?

     * Falstaff. The other night I fell asleep here behind the arras
       and had my pocket picked: this house is turned
       bawdy-house; they pick pockets. 2110

     * Henry V. What didst thou lose, Jack?

     * Falstaff. Wilt thou believe me, Hal? three or four bonds of
       forty pound apiece, and a seal-ring of my
       grandfather's.

     * Henry V. A trifle, some eight-penny matter. 2115

     * Hostess Quickly. So I told him, my lord; and I said I heard your
       grace say so: and, my lord, he speaks most vilely
       of you, like a foul-mouthed man as he is; and said
       he would cudgel you.

     * Henry V. What! he did not? 2120

     * Hostess Quickly. There's neither faith, truth, nor womanhood in me
       else.

     * Falstaff. There's no more faith in thee than in a stewed
       prune; nor no more truth in thee than in a drawn
       fox; and for womanhood, Maid Marian may be the
       deputy's wife of the ward to thee. Go, you thing, 2125
       go

     * Hostess Quickly. Say, what thing? what thing?

     * Falstaff. What thing! why, a thing to thank God on.

     * Hostess Quickly. I am no thing to thank God on, I would thou
       shouldst know it; I am an honest man's wife: and, 2130
       setting thy knighthood aside, thou art a knave to
       call me so.

     * Falstaff. Setting thy womanhood aside, thou art a beast to say
       otherwise.

     * Hostess Quickly. Say, what beast, thou knave, thou? 2135

     * Falstaff. What beast! why, an otter.

     * Henry V. An otter, Sir John! Why an otter?

     * Falstaff. Why, she's neither fish nor flesh; a man knows not
       where to have her.

     * Hostess Quickly. Thou art an unjust man in saying so: thou or any
       2140
       man knows where to have me, thou knave, thou!

     * Henry V. Thou sayest true, hostess; and he slanders thee most
       grossly.

     * Hostess Quickly. So he doth you, my lord; and said this other day
       you
       ought him a thousand pound.

     * Henry V. Sirrah, do I owe you a thousand pound? 2145

     * Falstaff. A thousand pound, Ha! a million: thy love is worth
       a million: thou owest me thy love.

     * Hostess Quickly. Nay, my lord, he called you Jack, and said he
       would
       cudgel you.

     * Falstaff. Did I, Bardolph? 2150

     * Lord Bardolph. Indeed, Sir John, you said so.

     * Falstaff. Yea, if he said my ring was copper.

     * Henry V. I say 'tis copper: darest thou be as good as thy word now?

     * Falstaff. Why, Hal, thou knowest, as thou art but man, I dare:
       but as thou art prince, I fear thee as I fear the 2155
       roaring of a lion's whelp.

     * Henry V. And why not as the lion?

     * Falstaff. The king is to be feared as the lion: dost thou
       think I'll fear thee as I fear thy father? nay, an
       I do, I pray God my girdle break. 2160

     * Henry V. O, if it should, how would thy guts fall about thy
       knees! But, sirrah, there's no room for faith,
       truth, nor honesty in this bosom of thine; it is all
       filled up with guts and midriff. Charge an honest
       woman with picking thy pocket! why, thou whoreson, 2165
       impudent, embossed rascal, if there were anything in
       thy pocket but tavern-reckonings, memorandums of
       bawdy-houses, and one poor penny-worth of
       sugar-candy to make thee long-winded, if thy pocket
       were enriched with any other injuries but these, I 2170
       am a villain: and yet you will stand to if; you will
       not pocket up wrong: art thou not ashamed?

     * Falstaff. Dost thou hear, Hal? thou knowest in the state of
       innocency Adam fell; and what should poor Jack
       Falstaff do in the days of villany? Thou seest I 2175
       have more flesh than another man, and therefore more
       frailty. You confess then, you picked my pocket?

     * Henry V. It appears so by the story.

     * Falstaff. Hostess, I forgive thee: go, make ready breakfast;
       love thy husband, look to thy servants, cherish thy 2180
       guests: thou shalt find me tractable to any honest
       reason: thou seest I am pacified still. Nay,
       prithee, be gone.
       [Exit Hostess]
       Now Hal, to the news at court: for the robbery, 2185
       lad, how is that answered?

     * Henry V. O, my sweet beef, I must still be good angel to
       thee: the money is paid back again.

     * Falstaff. O, I do not like that paying back; 'tis a double labour.

     * Henry V. I am good friends with my father and may do any thing.
       2190

     * Falstaff. Rob me the exchequer the first thing thou doest, and
       do it with unwashed hands too.

     * Lord Bardolph. Do, my lord.

     * Henry V. I have procured thee, Jack, a charge of foot.

     * Falstaff. I would it had been of horse. Where shall I find 2195
       one that can steal well? O for a fine thief, of the
       age of two and twenty or thereabouts! I am
       heinously unprovided. Well, God be thanked for
       these rebels, they offend none but the virtuous: I
       laud them, I praise them. 2200

     * Henry V. Bardolph!

     * Lord Bardolph. My lord?

     * Henry V. Go bear this letter to Lord John of Lancaster, to my
       brother John; this to my Lord of Westmoreland.
       [Exit Bardolph] 2205
       Go, Peto, to horse, to horse; for thou and I have
       thirty miles to ride yet ere dinner time.
       [Exit Peto]
       Jack, meet me to-morrow in the temple hall at two
       o'clock in the afternoon. 2210
       There shalt thou know thy charge; and there receive
       Money and order for their furniture.
       The land is burning; Percy stands on high;
       And either we or they must lower lie.

   [Exit PRINCE HENRY]
     * Falstaff. Rare words! brave world! Hostess, my breakfast, come!
       O, I could wish this tavern were my drum!

   [Exit]

   Act IV, Scene 1

   The rebel camp near Shrewsbury.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   [Enter HOTSPUR, WORCESTER, and DOUGLAS]
     * Hotspur (Henry Percy). Well said, my noble Scot: if speaking truth
       2220
       In this fine age were not thought flattery,
       Such attribution should the Douglas have,
       As not a soldier of this season's stamp
       Should go so general current through the world.
       By God, I cannot flatter; I do defy 2225
       The tongues of soothers; but a braver place
       In my heart's love hath no man than yourself:
       Nay, task me to my word; approve me, lord.

     * Earl of Douglas. Thou art the king of honour:
       No man so potent breathes upon the ground 2230
       But I will beard him.

     * Hotspur (Henry Percy). Do so, and 'tis well.
       [Enter a Messenger with letters]
       What letters hast thou there?—I can but thank you.

     * Messenger. These letters come from your father. 2235

     * Hotspur (Henry Percy). Letters from him! why comes he not himself?

     * Messenger. He cannot come, my lord; he is grievous sick.

     * Hotspur (Henry Percy). 'Zounds! how has he the leisure to be sick
       In such a rustling time? Who leads his power?
       Under whose government come they along? 2240

     * Messenger. His letters bear his mind, not I, my lord.

     * Earl of Worcester. I prithee, tell me, doth he keep his bed?

     * Messenger. He did, my lord, four days ere I set forth;
       And at the time of my departure thence
       He was much fear'd by his physicians. 2245

     * Earl of Worcester. I would the state of time had first been whole
       Ere he by sickness had been visited:
       His health was never better worth than now.

     * Hotspur (Henry Percy). Sick now! droop now! this sickness doth
       infect
       The very life-blood of our enterprise; 2250
       'Tis catching hither, even to our camp.
       He writes me here, that inward sickness—
       And that his friends by deputation could not
       So soon be drawn, nor did he think it meet
       To lay so dangerous and dear a trust 2255
       On any soul removed but on his own.
       Yet doth he give us bold advertisement,
       That with our small conjunction we should on,
       To see how fortune is disposed to us;
       For, as he writes, there is no quailing now. 2260
       Because the king is certainly possess'd
       Of all our purposes. What say you to it?

     * Earl of Worcester. Your father's sickness is a maim to us.

     * Hotspur (Henry Percy). A perilous gash, a very limb lopp'd off:
       And yet, in faith, it is not; his present want 2265
       Seems more than we shall find it: were it good
       To set the exact wealth of all our states
       All at one cast? to set so rich a main
       On the nice hazard of one doubtful hour?
       It were not good; for therein should we read 2270
       The very bottom and the soul of hope,
       The very list, the very utmost bound
       Of all our fortunes.

     * Earl of Douglas. 'Faith, and so we should;
       Where now remains a sweet reversion: 2275
       We may boldly spend upon the hope of what
       Is to come in:
       A comfort of retirement lives in this.

     * Hotspur (Henry Percy). A rendezvous, a home to fly unto.
       If that the devil and mischance look big 2280
       Upon the maidenhead of our affairs.

     * Earl of Worcester. But yet I would your father had been here.
       The quality and hair of our attempt
       Brooks no division: it will be thought
       By some, that know not why he is away, 2285
       That wisdom, loyalty and mere dislike
       Of our proceedings kept the earl from hence:
       And think how such an apprehension
       May turn the tide of fearful faction
       And breed a kind of question in our cause; 2290
       For well you know we of the offering side
       Must keep aloof from strict arbitrement,
       And stop all sight-holes, every loop from whence
       The eye of reason may pry in upon us:
       This absence of your father's draws a curtain, 2295
       That shows the ignorant a kind of fear
       Before not dreamt of.

     * Hotspur (Henry Percy). You strain too far.
       I rather of his absence make this use:
       It lends a lustre and more great opinion, 2300
       A larger dare to our great enterprise,
       Than if the earl were here; for men must think,
       If we without his help can make a head
       To push against a kingdom, with his help
       We shall o'erturn it topsy-turvy down. 2305
       Yet all goes well, yet all our joints are whole.

     * Earl of Douglas. As heart can think: there is not such a word
       Spoke of in Scotland as this term of fear.

   [Enter SIR RICHARD VERNON]
     * Hotspur (Henry Percy). My cousin Vernon, welcome, by my soul. 2310

     * Vernon. Pray God my news be worth a welcome, lord.
       The Earl of Westmoreland, seven thousand strong,
       Is marching hitherwards; with him Prince John.

     * Hotspur (Henry Percy). No harm: what more?

     * Vernon. And further, I have learn'd, 2315
       The king himself in person is set forth,
       Or hitherwards intended speedily,
       With strong and mighty preparation.

     * Hotspur (Henry Percy). He shall be welcome too. Where is his son,
       The nimble-footed madcap Prince of Wales, 2320
       And his comrades, that daff'd the world aside,
       And bid it pass?

     * Vernon. All furnish'd, all in arms;
       All plumed like estridges that with the wind
       Baited like eagles having lately bathed; 2325
       Glittering in golden coats, like images;
       As full of spirit as the month of May,
       And gorgeous as the sun at midsummer;
       Wanton as youthful goats, wild as young bulls.
       I saw young Harry, with his beaver on, 2330
       His cuisses on his thighs, gallantly arm'd
       Rise from the ground like feather'd Mercury,
       And vaulted with such ease into his seat,
       As if an angel dropp'd down from the clouds,
       To turn and wind a fiery Pegasus 2335
       And witch the world with noble horsemanship.

     * Hotspur (Henry Percy). No more, no more: worse than the sun in
       March,
       This praise doth nourish agues. Let them come:
       They come like sacrifices in their trim,
       And to the fire-eyed maid of smoky war 2340
       All hot and bleeding will we offer them:
       The mailed Mars shall on his altar sit
       Up to the ears in blood. I am on fire
       To hear this rich reprisal is so nigh
       And yet not ours. Come, let me taste my horse, 2345
       Who is to bear me like a thunderbolt
       Against the bosom of the Prince of Wales:
       Harry to Harry shall, hot horse to horse,
       Meet and ne'er part till one drop down a corse.
       O that Glendower were come! 2350

     * Vernon. There is more news:
       I learn'd in Worcester, as I rode along,
       He cannot draw his power this fourteen days.

     * Earl of Douglas. That's the worst tidings that I hear of yet.

     * Earl of Worcester. Ay, by my faith, that bears a frosty sound. 2355

     * Hotspur (Henry Percy). What may the king's whole battle reach unto?

     * Vernon. To thirty thousand.

     * Hotspur (Henry Percy). Forty let it be:
       My father and Glendower being both away,
       The powers of us may serve so great a day 2360
       Come, let us take a muster speedily:
       Doomsday is near; die all, die merrily.

     * Earl of Douglas. Talk not of dying: I am out of fear
       Of death or death's hand for this one-half year.

   [Exeunt]

   Act IV, Scene 2

   A public road near Coventry.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   [Enter FALSTAFF and BARDOLPH]
     * Falstaff. Bardolph, get thee before to Coventry; fill me a
       bottle of sack: our soldiers shall march through;
       we'll to Sutton Co'fil' tonight.

     * Lord Bardolph. Will you give me money, captain? 2370

     * Falstaff. Lay out, lay out.

     * Lord Bardolph. This bottle makes an angel.

     * Falstaff. An if it do, take it for thy labour; and if it make
       twenty, take them all; I'll answer the coinage. Bid
       my lieutenant Peto meet me at town's end. 2375

     * Lord Bardolph. I will, captain: farewell.

   [Exit]
     * Falstaff. If I be not ashamed of my soldiers, I am a soused
       gurnet. I have misused the king's press damnably.
       I have got, in exchange of a hundred and fifty 2380
       soldiers, three hundred and odd pounds. I press me
       none but good house-holders, yeoman's sons; inquire
       me out contracted bachelors, such as had been asked
       twice on the banns; such a commodity of warm slaves,
       as had as lieve hear the devil as a drum; such as 2385
       fear the report of a caliver worse than a struck
       fowl or a hurt wild-duck. I pressed me none but such
       toasts-and-butter, with hearts in their bellies no
       bigger than pins' heads, and they have bought out
       their services; and now my whole charge consists of 2390
       ancients, corporals, lieutenants, gentlemen of
       companies, slaves as ragged as Lazarus in the
       painted cloth, where the glutton's dogs licked his
       sores; and such as indeed were never soldiers, but
       discarded unjust serving-men, younger sons to 2395
       younger brothers, revolted tapsters and ostlers
       trade-fallen, the cankers of a calm world and a
       long peace, ten times more dishonourable ragged than
       an old faced ancient: and such have I, to fill up
       the rooms of them that have bought out their 2400
       services, that you would think that I had a hundred
       and fifty tattered prodigals lately come from
       swine-keeping, from eating draff and husks. A mad
       fellow met me on the way and told me I had unloaded
       all the gibbets and pressed the dead bodies. No eye 2405
       hath seen such scarecrows. I'll not march through
       Coventry with them, that's flat: nay, and the
       villains march wide betwixt the legs, as if they had
       gyves on; for indeed I had the most of them out of
       prison. There's but a shirt and a half in all my 2410
       company; and the half shirt is two napkins tacked
       together and thrown over the shoulders like an
       herald's coat without sleeves; and the shirt, to say
       the truth, stolen from my host at Saint Alban's, or
       the red-nose innkeeper of Daventry. But that's all 2415
       one; they'll find linen enough on every hedge.

   [Enter the PRINCE and WESTMORELAND]
     * Henry V. How now, blown Jack! how now, quilt!

     * Falstaff. What, Hal! how now, mad wag! what a devil dost thou
       in Warwickshire? My good Lord of Westmoreland, I 2420
       cry you mercy: I thought your honour had already been
       at Shrewsbury.

     * Earl of Westmoreland. Faith, Sir John,'tis more than time that I
       were
       there, and you too; but my powers are there already.
       The king, I can tell you, looks for us all: we must 2425
       away all night.

     * Falstaff. Tut, never fear me: I am as vigilant as a cat to
       steal cream.

     * Henry V. I think, to steal cream indeed, for thy theft hath
       already made thee butter. But tell me, Jack, whose 2430
       fellows are these that come after?

     * Falstaff. Mine, Hal, mine.

     * Henry V. I did never see such pitiful rascals.

     * Falstaff. Tut, tut; good enough to toss; food for powder, food
       for powder; they'll fill a pit as well as better: 2435
       tush, man, mortal men, mortal men.

     * Earl of Westmoreland. Ay, but, Sir John, methinks they are
       exceeding poor
       and bare, too beggarly.

     * Falstaff. 'Faith, for their poverty, I know not where they had
       that; and for their bareness, I am sure they never 2440
       learned that of me.

     * Henry V. No I'll be sworn; unless you call three fingers on
       the ribs bare. But, sirrah, make haste: Percy is
       already in the field.

     * Falstaff. What, is the king encamped? 2445

     * Earl of Westmoreland. He is, Sir John: I fear we shall stay too
       long.

     * Falstaff. Well,
       To the latter end of a fray and the beginning of a feast
       Fits a dull fighter and a keen guest.

   Act IV, Scene 3

   The rebel camp near Shrewsbury.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   [Enter HOTSPUR, WORCESTER, DOUGLAS, and VERNON]
     * Hotspur (Henry Percy). We'll fight with him to-night.

     * Earl of Worcester. It may not be.

     * Earl of Douglas. You give him then the advantage.

     * Vernon. Not a whit. 2455

     * Hotspur (Henry Percy). Why say you so? looks he not for supply?

     * Vernon. So do we.

     * Hotspur (Henry Percy). His is certain, ours is doubtful.

     * Earl of Worcester. Good cousin, be advised; stir not tonight.

     * Vernon. Do not, my lord. 2460

     * Earl of Douglas. You do not counsel well:
       You speak it out of fear and cold heart.

     * Vernon. Do me no slander, Douglas: by my life,
       And I dare well maintain it with my life,
       If well-respected honour bid me on, 2465
       I hold as little counsel with weak fear
       As you, my lord, or any Scot that this day lives:
       Let it be seen to-morrow in the battle
       Which of us fears.

     * Earl of Douglas. Yea, or to-night. 2470

     * Vernon. Content.

     * Hotspur (Henry Percy). To-night, say I.

     * Vernon. Come, come it nay not be. I wonder much,
       Being men of such great leading as you are,
       That you foresee not what impediments 2475
       Drag back our expedition: certain horse
       Of my cousin Vernon's are not yet come up:
       Your uncle Worcester's horse came but today;
       And now their pride and mettle is asleep,
       Their courage with hard labour tame and dull, 2480
       That not a horse is half the half of himself.

     * Hotspur (Henry Percy). So are the horses of the enemy
       In general, journey-bated and brought low:
       The better part of ours are full of rest.

     * Earl of Worcester. The number of the king exceedeth ours: 2485
       For God's sake. cousin, stay till all come in.

   [The trumpet sounds a parley]

   [Enter SIR WALTER BLUNT]
     * Blunt. I come with gracious offers from the king,
       if you vouchsafe me hearing and respect. 2490

     * Hotspur (Henry Percy). Welcome, Sir Walter Blunt; and would to God
       You were of our determination!
       Some of us love you well; and even those some
       Envy your great deservings and good name,
       Because you are not of our quality, 2495
       But stand against us like an enemy.

     * Blunt. And God defend but still I should stand so,
       So long as out of limit and true rule
       You stand against anointed majesty.
       But to my charge. The king hath sent to know 2500
       The nature of your griefs, and whereupon
       You conjure from the breast of civil peace
       Such bold hostility, teaching his duteous land
       Audacious cruelty. If that the king
       Have any way your good deserts forgot, 2505
       Which he confesseth to be manifold,
       He bids you name your griefs; and with all speed
       You shall have your desires with interest
       And pardon absolute for yourself and these
       Herein misled by your suggestion. 2510

     * Hotspur (Henry Percy). The king is kind; and well we know the king
       Knows at what time to promise, when to pay.
       My father and my uncle and myself
       Did give him that same royalty he wears;
       And when he was not six and twenty strong, 2515
       Sick in the world's regard, wretched and low,
       A poor unminded outlaw sneaking home,
       My father gave him welcome to the shore;
       And when he heard him swear and vow to God
       He came but to be Duke of Lancaster, 2520
       To sue his livery and beg his peace,
       With tears of innocency and terms of zeal,
       My father, in kind heart and pity moved,
       Swore him assistance and perform'd it too.
       Now when the lords and barons of the realm 2525
       Perceived Northumberland did lean to him,
       The more and less came in with cap and knee;
       Met him in boroughs, cities, villages,
       Attended him on bridges, stood in lanes,
       Laid gifts before him, proffer'd him their oaths, 2530
       Gave him their heirs, as pages follow'd him
       Even at the heels in golden multitudes.
       He presently, as greatness knows itself,
       Steps me a little higher than his vow
       Made to my father, while his blood was poor, 2535
       Upon the naked shore at Ravenspurgh;
       And now, forsooth, takes on him to reform
       Some certain edicts and some strait decrees
       That lie too heavy on the commonwealth,
       Cries out upon abuses, seems to weep 2540
       Over his country's wrongs; and by this face,
       This seeming brow of justice, did he win
       The hearts of all that he did angle for;
       Proceeded further; cut me off the heads
       Of all the favourites that the absent king 2545
       In deputation left behind him here,
       When he was personal in the Irish war.

     * Blunt. Tut, I came not to hear this.

     * Hotspur (Henry Percy). Then to the point.
       In short time after, he deposed the king; 2550
       Soon after that, deprived him of his life;
       And in the neck of that, task'd the whole state:
       To make that worse, suffer'd his kinsman March,
       Who is, if every owner were well placed,
       Indeed his king, to be engaged in Wales, 2555
       There without ransom to lie forfeited;
       Disgraced me in my happy victories,
       Sought to entrap me by intelligence;
       Rated mine uncle from the council-board;
       In rage dismiss'd my father from the court; 2560
       Broke oath on oath, committed wrong on wrong,
       And in conclusion drove us to seek out
       This head of safety; and withal to pry
       Into his title, the which we find
       Too indirect for long continuance. 2565

     * Blunt. Shall I return this answer to the king?

     * Hotspur (Henry Percy). Not so, Sir Walter: we'll withdraw awhile.
       Go to the king; and let there be impawn'd
       Some surety for a safe return again,
       And in the morning early shall my uncle 2570
       Bring him our purposes: and so farewell.

     * Blunt. I would you would accept of grace and love.

     * Hotspur (Henry Percy). And may be so we shall.

     * Blunt. Pray God you do.

   Act IV, Scene 4

   York. The ARCHBISHOP’S palace.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   [Enter the ARCHBISHOP and SIR MICHAEL]
     * Archbishop Scroop. Hie, good Sir Michael; bear this sealed brief
       With winged haste to the lord marshal;
       This to my cousin Scroop, and all the rest
       To whom they are directed. If you knew 2580
       How much they do to import, you would make haste.

     * Sir Michael. My good lord,
       I guess their tenor.

     * Archbishop Scroop. Like enough you do.
       To-morrow, good Sir Michael, is a day 2585
       Wherein the fortune of ten thousand men
       Must bide the touch; for, sir, at Shrewsbury,
       As I am truly given to understand,
       The king with mighty and quick-raised power
       Meets with Lord Harry: and, I fear, Sir Michael, 2590
       What with the sickness of Northumberland,
       Whose power was in the first proportion,
       And what with Owen Glendower's absence thence,
       Who with them was a rated sinew too
       And comes not in, o'er-ruled by prophecies, 2595
       I fear the power of Percy is too weak
       To wage an instant trial with the king.

     * Sir Michael. Why, my good lord, you need not fear;
       There is Douglas and Lord Mortimer.

     * Archbishop Scroop. No, Mortimer is not there. 2600

     * Sir Michael. But there is Mordake, Vernon, Lord Harry Percy,
       And there is my Lord of Worcester and a head
       Of gallant warriors, noble gentlemen.

     * Archbishop Scroop. And so there is: but yet the king hath drawn
       The special head of all the land together: 2605
       The Prince of Wales, Lord John of Lancaster,
       The noble Westmoreland and warlike Blunt;
       And moe corrivals and dear men
       Of estimation and command in arms.

     * Sir Michael. Doubt not, my lord, they shall be well opposed. 2610

     * Archbishop Scroop. I hope no less, yet needful 'tis to fear;
       And, to prevent the worst, Sir Michael, speed:
       For if Lord Percy thrive not, ere the king
       Dismiss his power, he means to visit us,
       For he hath heard of our confederacy, 2615
       And 'tis but wisdom to make strong against him:
       Therefore make haste. I must go write again
       To other friends; and so farewell, Sir Michael.

   Act V, Scene 1

   KING HENRY IV’s camp near Shrewsbury.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   [Enter KING HENRY, PRINCE HENRY, Lord John of LANCASTER, EARL OF
   WESTMORELAND, SIR WALTER BLUNT, and FALSTAFF]
     * Henry IV. How bloodily the sun begins to peer
       Above yon busky hill! the day looks pale
       At his distemperature.

     * Henry V. The southern wind
       Doth play the trumpet to his purposes, 2625
       And by his hollow whistling in the leaves
       Foretells a tempest and a blustering day.

     * Henry IV. Then with the losers let it sympathize,
       For nothing can seem foul to those that win.
       [The trumpet sounds] 2630
       [Enter WORCESTER and VERNON]
       How now, my Lord of Worcester! 'tis not well
       That you and I should meet upon such terms
       As now we meet. You have deceived our trust,
       And made us doff our easy robes of peace, 2635
       To crush our old limbs in ungentle steel:
       This is not well, my lord, this is not well.
       What say you to it? will you again unknit
       This curlish knot of all-abhorred war?
       And move in that obedient orb again 2640
       Where you did give a fair and natural light,
       And be no more an exhaled meteor,
       A prodigy of fear and a portent
       Of broached mischief to the unborn times?

     * Earl of Worcester. Hear me, my liege: 2645
       For mine own part, I could be well content
       To entertain the lag-end of my life
       With quiet hours; for I do protest,
       I have not sought the day of this dislike.

     * Henry IV. You have not sought it! how comes it, then? 2650

     * Falstaff. Rebellion lay in his way, and he found it.

     * Henry V. Peace, chewet, peace!

     * Earl of Worcester. It pleased your majesty to turn your looks
       Of favour from myself and all our house;
       And yet I must remember you, my lord, 2655
       We were the first and dearest of your friends.
       For you my staff of office did I break
       In Richard's time; and posted day and night
       to meet you on the way, and kiss your hand,
       When yet you were in place and in account 2660
       Nothing so strong and fortunate as I.
       It was myself, my brother and his son,
       That brought you home and boldly did outdare
       The dangers of the time. You swore to us,
       And you did swear that oath at Doncaster, 2665
       That you did nothing purpose 'gainst the state;
       Nor claim no further than your new-fall'n right,
       The seat of Gaunt, dukedom of Lancaster:
       To this we swore our aid. But in short space
       It rain'd down fortune showering on your head; 2670
       And such a flood of greatness fell on you,
       What with our help, what with the absent king,
       What with the injuries of a wanton time,
       The seeming sufferances that you had borne,
       And the contrarious winds that held the king 2675
       So long in his unlucky Irish wars
       That all in England did repute him dead:
       And from this swarm of fair advantages
       You took occasion to be quickly woo'd
       To gripe the general sway into your hand; 2680
       Forget your oath to us at Doncaster;
       And being fed by us you used us so
       As that ungentle hull, the cuckoo's bird,
       Useth the sparrow; did oppress our nest;
       Grew by our feeding to so great a bulk 2685
       That even our love durst not come near your sight
       For fear of swallowing; but with nimble wing
       We were enforced, for safety sake, to fly
       Out of sight and raise this present head;
       Whereby we stand opposed by such means 2690
       As you yourself have forged against yourself
       By unkind usage, dangerous countenance,
       And violation of all faith and troth
       Sworn to us in your younger enterprise.

     * Henry IV. These things indeed you have articulate, 2695
       Proclaim'd at market-crosses, read in churches,
       To face the garment of rebellion
       With some fine colour that may please the eye
       Of fickle changelings and poor discontents,
       Which gape and rub the elbow at the news 2700
       Of hurlyburly innovation:
       And never yet did insurrection want
       Such water-colours to impaint his cause;
       Nor moody beggars, starving for a time
       Of pellmell havoc and confusion. 2705

     * Henry V. In both your armies there is many a soul
       Shall pay full dearly for this encounter,
       If once they join in trial. Tell your nephew,
       The Prince of Wales doth join with all the world
       In praise of Henry Percy: by my hopes, 2710
       This present enterprise set off his head,
       I do not think a braver gentleman,
       More active-valiant or more valiant-young,
       More daring or more bold, is now alive
       To grace this latter age with noble deeds. 2715
       For my part, I may speak it to my shame,
       I have a truant been to chivalry;
       And so I hear he doth account me too;
       Yet this before my father's majesty—
       I am content that he shall take the odds 2720
       Of his great name and estimation,
       And will, to save the blood on either side,
       Try fortune with him in a single fight.

     * Henry IV. And, Prince of Wales, so dare we venture thee,
       Albeit considerations infinite 2725
       Do make against it. No, good Worcester, no,
       We love our people well; even those we love
       That are misled upon your cousin's part;
       And, will they take the offer of our grace,
       Both he and they and you, every man 2730
       Shall be my friend again and I'll be his:
       So tell your cousin, and bring me word
       What he will do: but if he will not yield,
       Rebuke and dread correction wait on us
       And they shall do their office. So, be gone; 2735
       We will not now be troubled with reply:
       We offer fair; take it advisedly.

   [Exeunt WORCESTER and VERNON]
     * Henry V. It will not be accepted, on my life:
       The Douglas and the Hotspur both together 2740
       Are confident against the world in arms.

     * Henry IV. Hence, therefore, every leader to his charge;
       For, on their answer, will we set on them:
       And God befriend us, as our cause is just!

   [Exeunt all but PRINCE HENRY and FALSTAFF]
     * Falstaff. Hal, if thou see me down in the battle and bestride
       me, so; 'tis a point of friendship.

     * Henry V. Nothing but a colossus can do thee that friendship.
       Say thy prayers, and farewell.

     * Falstaff. I would 'twere bed-time, Hal, and all well. 2750

     * Henry V. Why, thou owest God a death.

   [Exit PRINCE HENRY]
     * Falstaff. 'Tis not due yet; I would be loath to pay him before
       his day. What need I be so forward with him that
       calls not on me? Well, 'tis no matter; honour pricks 2755
       me on. Yea, but how if honour prick me off when I
       come on? how then? Can honour set to a leg? no: or
       an arm? no: or take away the grief of a wound? no.
       Honour hath no skill in surgery, then? no. What is
       honour? a word. What is in that word honour? what 2760
       is that honour? air. A trim reckoning! Who hath it?
       he that died o' Wednesday. Doth he feel it? no.
       Doth he hear it? no. 'Tis insensible, then. Yea,
       to the dead. But will it not live with the living?
       no. Why? detraction will not suffer it. Therefore 2765
       I'll none of it. Honour is a mere scutcheon: and so
       ends my catechism.

   [Exit]

   Act V, Scene 2

   The rebel camp.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   [Enter WORCESTER and VERNON]
     * Earl of Worcester. O, no, my nephew must not know, Sir Richard,
       2770
       The liberal and kind offer of the king.

     * Vernon. 'Twere best he did.

     * Earl of Worcester. Then are we all undone.
       It is not possible, it cannot be,
       The king should keep his word in loving us; 2775
       He will suspect us still and find a time
       To punish this offence in other faults:
       Suspicion all our lives shall be stuck full of eyes;
       For treason is but trusted like the fox,
       Who, ne'er so tame, so cherish'd and lock'd up, 2780
       Will have a wild trick of his ancestors.
       Look how we can, or sad or merrily,
       Interpretation will misquote our looks,
       And we shall feed like oxen at a stall,
       The better cherish'd, still the nearer death. 2785
       My nephew's trespass may be well forgot;
       it hath the excuse of youth and heat of blood,
       And an adopted name of privilege,
       A hair-brain'd Hotspur, govern'd by a spleen:
       All his offences live upon my head 2790
       And on his father's; we did train him on,
       And, his corruption being ta'en from us,
       We, as the spring of all, shall pay for all.
       Therefore, good cousin, let not Harry know,
       In any case, the offer of the king. 2795

     * Vernon. Deliver what you will; I'll say 'tis so.
       Here comes your cousin.

   [Enter HOTSPUR and DOUGLAS]
     * Hotspur (Henry Percy). My uncle is return'd:
       Deliver up my Lord of Westmoreland. 2800
       Uncle, what news?

     * Earl of Worcester. The king will bid you battle presently.

     * Earl of Douglas. Defy him by the Lord of Westmoreland.

     * Hotspur (Henry Percy). Lord Douglas, go you and tell him so.

     * Earl of Douglas. Marry, and shall, and very willingly. 2805

   [Exit]
     * Earl of Worcester. There is no seeming mercy in the king.

     * Hotspur (Henry Percy). Did you beg any? God forbid!

     * Earl of Worcester. I told him gently of our grievances,
       Of his oath-breaking; which he mended thus, 2810
       By now forswearing that he is forsworn:
       He calls us rebels, traitors; and will scourge
       With haughty arms this hateful name in us.

   [Re-enter the EARL OF DOUGLAS]
     * Earl of Douglas. Arm, gentlemen; to arms! for I have thrown 2815
       A brave defiance in King Henry's teeth,
       And Westmoreland, that was engaged, did bear it;
       Which cannot choose but bring him quickly on.

     * Earl of Worcester. The Prince of Wales stepp'd forth before the
       king,
       And, nephew, challenged you to single fight. 2820

     * Hotspur (Henry Percy). O, would the quarrel lay upon our heads,
       And that no man might draw short breath today
       But I and Harry Monmouth! Tell me, tell me,
       How show'd his tasking? seem'd it in contempt?

     * Vernon. No, by my soul; I never in my life 2825
       Did hear a challenge urged more modestly,
       Unless a brother should a brother dare
       To gentle exercise and proof of arms.
       He gave you all the duties of a man;
       Trimm'd up your praises with a princely tongue, 2830
       Spoke to your deservings like a chronicle,
       Making you ever better than his praise
       By still dispraising praise valued in you;
       And, which became him like a prince indeed,
       He made a blushing cital of himself; 2835
       And chid his truant youth with such a grace
       As if he master'd there a double spirit.
       Of teaching and of learning instantly.
       There did he pause: but let me tell the world,
       If he outlive the envy of this day, 2840
       England did never owe so sweet a hope,
       So much misconstrued in his wantonness.

     * Hotspur (Henry Percy). Cousin, I think thou art enamoured
       On his follies: never did I hear
       Of any prince so wild a libertine. 2845
       But be he as he will, yet once ere night
       I will embrace him with a soldier's arm,
       That he shall shrink under my courtesy.
       Arm, arm with speed: and, fellows, soldiers, friends,
       Better consider what you have to do 2850
       Than I, that have not well the gift of tongue,
       Can lift your blood up with persuasion.

   [Enter a Messenger]
     * Messenger. My lord, here are letters for you.

     * Hotspur (Henry Percy). I cannot read them now. 2855
       O gentlemen, the time of life is short!
       To spend that shortness basely were too long,
       If life did ride upon a dial's point,
       Still ending at the arrival of an hour.
       An if we live, we live to tread on kings; 2860
       If die, brave death, when princes die with us!
       Now, for our consciences, the arms are fair,
       When the intent of bearing them is just.

   [Enter another Messenger]
     * Messenger. My lord, prepare; the king comes on apace. 2865

     * Hotspur (Henry Percy). I thank him, that he cuts me from my tale,
       For I profess not talking; only this—
       Let each man do his best: and here draw I
       A sword, whose temper I intend to stain
       With the best blood that I can meet withal 2870
       In the adventure of this perilous day.
       Now, Esperance! Percy! and set on.
       Sound all the lofty instruments of war,
       And by that music let us all embrace;
       For, heaven to earth, some of us never shall 2875
       A second time do such a courtesy.

   [The trumpets sound. They embrace, and exeunt]

   Act V, Scene 3

   Plain between the camps.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   [KING HENRY enters with his power. Alarum to the battle. Then enter
   DOUGLAS and SIR WALTER BLUNT]
     * Blunt. What is thy name, that in the battle thus
       Thou crossest me? what honour dost thou seek 2880
       Upon my head?

     * Earl of Douglas. Know then, my name is Douglas;
       And I do haunt thee in the battle thus
       Because some tell me that thou art a king.

     * Blunt. They tell thee true. 2885

     * Earl of Douglas. The Lord of Stafford dear to-day hath bought
       Thy likeness, for instead of thee, King Harry,
       This sword hath ended him: so shall it thee,
       Unless thou yield thee as my prisoner.

     * Blunt. I was not born a yielder, thou proud Scot; 2890
       And thou shalt find a king that will revenge
       Lord Stafford's death.

   [They fight. DOUGLAS kills SIR WALTER BLUNT.

   Enter HOTSPUR]
     * Hotspur (Henry Percy). O Douglas, hadst thou fought at Holmedon
       thus, 2895
       never had triumph'd upon a Scot.

     * Earl of Douglas. All's done, all's won; here breathless lies the
       king.

     * Hotspur (Henry Percy). Where?

     * Earl of Douglas. Here.

     * Hotspur (Henry Percy). This, Douglas? no: I know this face full
       well: 2900
       A gallant knight he was, his name was Blunt;
       Semblably furnish'd like the king himself.

     * Earl of Douglas. A fool go with thy soul, whither it goes!
       A borrow'd title hast thou bought too dear:
       Why didst thou tell me that thou wert a king? 2905

     * Hotspur (Henry Percy). The king hath many marching in his coats.

     * Earl of Douglas. Now, by my sword, I will kill all his coats;
       I'll murder all his wardrobe, piece by piece,
       Until I meet the king.

     * Hotspur (Henry Percy). Up, and away! 2910
       Our soldiers stand full fairly for the day.

   [Exeunt]

   [Alarum. Enter FALSTAFF, solus]
     * Falstaff. Though I could 'scape shot-free at London, I fear
       the shot here; here's no scoring but upon the pate. 2915
       Soft! who are you? Sir Walter Blunt: there's honour
       for you! here's no vanity! I am as hot as moulten
       lead, and as heavy too: God keep lead out of me! I
       need no more weight than mine own bowels. I have
       led my ragamuffins where they are peppered: there's 2920
       not three of my hundred and fifty left alive; and
       they are for the town's end, to beg during life.
       But who comes here?

   [Enter PRINCE HENRY]
     * Henry V. What, stand'st thou idle here? lend me thy sword: 2925
       Many a nobleman lies stark and stiff
       Under the hoofs of vaunting enemies,
       Whose deaths are yet unrevenged: I prithee,
       lend me thy sword.

     * Falstaff. O Hal, I prithee, give me leave to breathe awhile. 2930
       Turk Gregory never did such deeds in arms as I have
       done this day. I have paid Percy, I have made him sure.

     * Henry V. He is, indeed; and living to kill thee. I prithee,
       lend me thy sword.

     * Falstaff. Nay, before God, Hal, if Percy be alive, thou get'st 2935
       not my sword; but take my pistol, if thou wilt.

     * Henry V. Give it to me: what, is it in the case?

     * Falstaff. Ay, Hal; 'tis hot, 'tis hot; there's that will sack a
       city.

   [PRINCE HENRY draws it out, and finds it to be a bottle of sack]
     * Henry V. What, is it a time to jest and dally now? 2940

   [He throws the bottle at him. Exit]
     * Falstaff. Well, if Percy be alive, I'll pierce him. If he do
       come in my way, so: if he do not, if I come in his
       willingly, let him make a carbonado of me. I like
       not such grinning honour as Sir Walter hath: give me 2945
       life: which if I can save, so; if not, honour comes
       unlooked for, and there's an end.

   [Exit FALSTAFF]

   Act V, Scene 4

   Another part of the field.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   [Alarum. Excursions. Enter PRINCE HENRY, LORD JOHN OF LANCASTER, and
   EARL OF WESTMORELAND]
     * Henry IV. I prithee, 2950
       Harry, withdraw thyself; thou bleed'st too much.
       Lord John of Lancaster, go you with him.

     * Prince John. Not I, my lord, unless I did bleed too.

     * Henry V. I beseech your majesty, make up,
       Lest your retirement do amaze your friends. 2955

     * Henry IV. I will do so.
       My Lord of Westmoreland, lead him to his tent.

     * Earl of Westmoreland. Come, my lord, I'll lead you to your tent.

     * Henry V. Lead me, my lord? I do not need your help:
       And God forbid a shallow scratch should drive 2960
       The Prince of Wales from such a field as this,
       Where stain'd nobility lies trodden on,
       and rebels' arms triumph in massacres!

     * Prince John. We breathe too long: come, cousin Westmoreland,
       Our duty this way lies; for God's sake come. 2965

   [Exeunt LANCASTER and WESTMORELAND]
     * Henry V. By God, thou hast deceived me, Lancaster;
       I did not think thee lord of such a spirit:
       Before, I loved thee as a brother, John;
       But now, I do respect thee as my soul. 2970

     * Henry IV. I saw him hold Lord Percy at the point
       With lustier maintenance than I did look for
       Of such an ungrown warrior.

     * Henry V. O, this boy
       Lends mettle to us all! 2975

   [Exit]

   [Enter DOUGLAS]
     * Earl of Douglas. Another king! they grow like Hydra's heads:
       I am the Douglas, fatal to all those
       That wear those colours on them: what art thou, 2980
       That counterfeit'st the person of a king?

     * Henry IV. The king himself; who, Douglas, grieves at heart
       So many of his shadows thou hast met
       And not the very king. I have two boys
       Seek Percy and thyself about the field: 2985
       But, seeing thou fall'st on me so luckily,
       I will assay thee: so, defend thyself.

     * Earl of Douglas. I fear thou art another counterfeit;
       And yet, in faith, thou bear'st thee like a king:
       But mine I am sure thou art, whoe'er thou be, 2990
       And thus I win thee.

   [They fight. KING HENRY being in danger, PRINCE HENRY enters]
     * Henry V. Hold up thy head, vile Scot, or thou art like
       Never to hold it up again! the spirits
       Of valiant Shirley, Stafford, Blunt, are in my arms: 2995
       It is the Prince of Wales that threatens thee;
       Who never promiseth but he means to pay.
       [They fight: DOUGLAS flies]
       Cheerly, my lord. how fares your grace?
       Sir Nicholas Gawsey hath for succor sent, 3000
       And so hath Clifton: I'll to Clifton straight.

     * Henry IV. Stay, and breathe awhile:
       Thou hast redeem'd thy lost opinion,
       And show'd thou makest some tender of my life,
       In this fair rescue thou hast brought to me. 3005

     * Henry V. O God! they did me too much injury
       That ever said I hearken'd for your death.
       If it were so, I might have let alone
       The insulting hand of Douglas over you,
       Which would have been as speedy in your end 3010
       As all the poisonous potions in the world
       And saved the treacherous labour of your son.

     * Henry IV. Make up to Clifton: I'll to Sir Nicholas Gawsey.

   [Exit]

   [Enter HOTSPUR]
     * Hotspur (Henry Percy). If I mistake not, thou art Harry Monmouth.

     * Henry V. Thou speak'st as if I would deny my name.

     * Hotspur (Henry Percy). My name is Harry Percy.

     * Henry V. Why, then I see
       A very valiant rebel of the name. 3020
       I am the Prince of Wales; and think not, Percy,
       To share with me in glory any more:
       Two stars keep not their motion in one sphere;
       Nor can one England brook a double reign,
       Of Harry Percy and the Prince of Wales. 3025

     * Hotspur (Henry Percy). Nor shall it, Harry; for the hour is come
       To end the one of us; and would to God
       Thy name in arms were now as great as mine!

     * Henry V. I'll make it greater ere I part from thee;
       And all the budding honours on thy crest 3030
       I'll crop, to make a garland for my head.

     * Hotspur (Henry Percy). I can no longer brook thy vanities.

   [They fight]

   [Enter FALSTAFF]
     * Falstaff. Well said, Hal! to it Hal! Nay, you shall find no 3035
       boy's play here, I can tell you.
       [Re-enter DOUGLAS; he fights with FALSTAFF,]
       who falls down as if he were dead, and exit
       DOUGLAS. HOTSPUR is wounded, and falls]

     * Hotspur (Henry Percy). O, Harry, thou hast robb'd me of my youth!
       3040
       I better brook the loss of brittle life
       Than those proud titles thou hast won of me;
       They wound my thoughts worse than sword my flesh:
       But thought's the slave of life, and life time's fool;
       And time, that takes survey of all the world, 3045
       Must have a stop. O, I could prophesy,
       But that the earthy and cold hand of death
       Lies on my tongue: no, Percy, thou art dust
       And food for—

   [Dies]
     * Henry V. For worms, brave Percy: fare thee well, great heart!
       Ill-weaved ambition, how much art thou shrunk!
       When that this body did contain a spirit,
       A kingdom for it was too small a bound;
       But now two paces of the vilest earth 3055
       Is room enough: this earth that bears thee dead
       Bears not alive so stout a gentleman.
       If thou wert sensible of courtesy,
       I should not make so dear a show of zeal:
       But let my favours hide thy mangled face; 3060
       And, even in thy behalf, I'll thank myself
       For doing these fair rites of tenderness.
       Adieu, and take thy praise with thee to heaven!
       Thy ignominy sleep with thee in the grave,
       But not remember'd in thy epitaph! 3065
       [He spieth FALSTAFF on the ground]
       What, old acquaintance! could not all this flesh
       Keep in a little life? Poor Jack, farewell!
       I could have better spared a better man:
       O, I should have a heavy miss of thee, 3070
       If I were much in love with vanity!
       Death hath not struck so fat a deer to-day,
       Though many dearer, in this bloody fray.
       Embowell'd will I see thee by and by:
       Till then in blood by noble Percy lie. 3075

   [Exit PRINCE HENRY]
     * Falstaff. [Rising up] Embowelled! if thou embowel me to-day,
       I'll give you leave to powder me and eat me too
       to-morrow. 'Sblood,'twas time to counterfeit, or
       that hot termagant Scot had paid me scot and lot too. 3080
       Counterfeit? I lie, I am no counterfeit: to die,
       is to be a counterfeit; for he is but the
       counterfeit of a man who hath not the life of a man:
       but to counterfeit dying, when a man thereby
       liveth, is to be no counterfeit, but the true and 3085
       perfect image of life indeed. The better part of
       valour is discretion; in the which better part I
       have saved my life.'Zounds, I am afraid of this
       gunpowder Percy, though he be dead: how, if he
       should counterfeit too and rise? by my faith, I am 3090
       afraid he would prove the better counterfeit.
       Therefore I'll make him sure; yea, and I'll swear I
       killed him. Why may not he rise as well as I?
       Nothing confutes me but eyes, and nobody sees me.
       Therefore, sirrah, 3095
       [Stabbing him]
       with a new wound in your thigh, come you along with me.

   [Takes up HOTSPUR on his back]

   [Re-enter PRINCE HENRY and LORD JOHN OF LANCASTER]
     * Henry V. Come, brother John; full bravely hast thou flesh'd 3100
       Thy maiden sword.

     * Prince John. But, soft! whom have we here?
       Did you not tell me this fat man was dead?

     * Henry V. I did; I saw him dead,
       Breathless and bleeding on the ground. Art 3105
       thou alive?
       Or is it fantasy that plays upon our eyesight?
       I prithee, speak; we will not trust our eyes
       Without our ears: thou art not what thou seem'st.

     * Falstaff. No, that's certain; I am not a double man: but if I 3110
       be not Jack Falstaff, then am I a Jack. There is Percy:
       [Throwing the body down]
       if your father will do me any honour, so; if not, let
       him kill the next Percy himself. I look to be either
       earl or duke, I can assure you. 3115

     * Henry V. Why, Percy I killed myself and saw thee dead.

     * Falstaff. Didst thou? Lord, Lord, how this world is given to
       lying! I grant you I was down and out of breath;
       and so was he: but we rose both at an instant and
       fought a long hour by Shrewsbury clock. If I may be 3120
       believed, so; if not, let them that should reward
       valour bear the sin upon their own heads. I'll take
       it upon my death, I gave him this wound in the
       thigh: if the man were alive and would deny it,
       'zounds, I would make him eat a piece of my sword. 3125

     * Prince John. This is the strangest tale that ever I heard.

     * Henry V. This is the strangest fellow, brother John.
       Come, bring your luggage nobly on your back:
       For my part, if a lie may do thee grace,
       I'll gild it with the happiest terms I have. 3130
       [A retreat is sounded]
       The trumpet sounds retreat; the day is ours.
       Come, brother, let us to the highest of the field,
       To see what friends are living, who are dead.

   [Exeunt PRINCE HENRY and LANCASTER]
     * Falstaff. I'll follow, as they say, for reward. He that
       rewards me, God reward him! If I do grow great,
       I'll grow less; for I'll purge, and leave sack, and
       live cleanly as a nobleman should do.

   [Exit]

   Act V, Scene 5

   Another part of the field.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   [The trumpets sound. Enter KING HENRY IV, PRINCE HENRY, LORD JOHN
   LANCASTER, EARL OF WESTMORELAND, with WORCESTER and VERNON prisoners]
     * Henry IV. Thus ever did rebellion find rebuke.
       Ill-spirited Worcester! did not we send grace,
       Pardon and terms of love to all of you?
       And wouldst thou turn our offers contrary? 3145
       Misuse the tenor of thy kinsman's trust?
       Three knights upon our party slain to-day,
       A noble earl and many a creature else
       Had been alive this hour,
       If like a Christian thou hadst truly borne 3150
       Betwixt our armies true intelligence.

     * Earl of Worcester. What I have done my safety urged me to;
       And I embrace this fortune patiently,
       Since not to be avoided it falls on me.

     * Henry IV. Bear Worcester to the death and Vernon too: 3155
       Other offenders we will pause upon.
       [Exeunt WORCESTER and VERNON, guarded]
       How goes the field?

     * Henry V. The noble Scot, Lord Douglas, when he saw
       The fortune of the day quite turn'd from him, 3160
       The noble Percy slain, and all his men
       Upon the foot of fear, fled with the rest;
       And falling from a hill, he was so bruised
       That the pursuers took him. At my tent
       The Douglas is; and I beseech your grace 3165
       I may dispose of him.

     * Henry IV. With all my heart.

     * Henry V. Then, brother John of Lancaster, to you
       This honourable bounty shall belong:
       Go to the Douglas, and deliver him 3170
       Up to his pleasure, ransomless and free:
       His valour shown upon our crests to-day
       Hath taught us how to cherish such high deeds
       Even in the bosom of our adversaries.

     * Prince John. I thank your grace for this high courtesy, 3175
       Which I shall give away immediately.

     * Henry IV. Then this remains, that we divide our power.
       You, son John, and my cousin Westmoreland
       Towards York shall bend you with your dearest speed,
       To meet Northumberland and the prelate Scroop, 3180
       Who, as we hear, are busily in arms:
       Myself and you, son Harry, will towards Wales,
       To fight with Glendower and the Earl of March.
       Rebellion in this land shall lose his sway,
       Meeting the cheque of such another day: 3185
       And since this business so fair is done,
       Let us not leave till all our own be won.
