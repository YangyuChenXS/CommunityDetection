                 Then hate me when thou wilt; if ever, now;
               Now, while the world is bent my deeds to cross,
                Join with the spite of fortune, make me bow,
                    And do not drop in for an after-loss:
            Ah, do not, when my heart hath 'scoped this sorrow, 5
                  Come in the rearward of a conquer'd woe;
                   Give not a windy night a rainy morrow,
                     To linger out a purposed overthrow.
                If thou wilt leave me, do not leave me last,
              When other petty griefs have done their spite 10
                   But in the onset come; so shall I taste
                 At first the very worst of fortune's might,
                  And other strains of woe, which now seem woe,
                 Compared with loss of thee will not seem so. 14
