   Prologue
   _______________________________________________________________________

   Enter RUMOUR, painted full of tongues
     * Rumour. Open your ears; for which of you will stop
       The vent of hearing when loud Rumour speaks?
       I, from the orient to the drooping west,
       Making the wind my post-horse, still unfold 5
       The acts commenced on this ball of earth.
       Upon my tongues continual slanders ride,
       The which in every language I pronounce,
       Stuffing the ears of men with false reports.
       I speak of peace while covert emnity, 10
       Under the smile of safety, wounds the world;
       And who but Rumour, who but only I,
       Make fearful musters and prepar'd defence,
       Whiles the big year, swoln with some other grief,
       Is thought with child by the stern tyrant war, 15
       And no such matter? Rumour is a pipe
       Blown by surmises, jealousies, conjectures,
       And of so easy and so plain a stop
       That the blunt monster with uncounted heads,
       The still-discordant wav'ring multitude, 20
       Can play upon it. But what need I thus
       My well-known body to anatomize
       Among my household? Why is Rumour here?
       I run before King Harry's victory,
       Who, in a bloody field by Shrewsbury, 25
       Hath beaten down young Hotspur and his troops,
       Quenching the flame of bold rebellion
       Even with the rebels' blood. But what mean I
       To speak so true at first? My office is
       To noise abroad that Harry Monmouth fell 30
       Under the wrath of noble Hotspur's sword,
       And that the King before the Douglas' rage
       Stoop'd his anointed head as low as death.
       This have I rumour'd through the peasant towns
       Between that royal field of Shrewsbury 35
       And this worm-eaten hold of ragged stone,
       Where Hotspur's father, old Northumberland,
       Lies crafty-sick. The posts come tiring on,
       And not a man of them brings other news
       Than they have learnt of me. From Rumour's tongues 40
       They bring smooth comforts false, worse than true wrongs.

   Act I, Scene 1

   Warkworth. Before NORTHUMBERLAND’S Castle
   _______________________________________________________________________

   Enter LORD BARDOLPH
     * Lord Bardolph. Who keeps the gate here, ho? [The PORTER opens the
       gate]
       Where is the Earl? 45

     * Porter. What shall I say you are?

     * Lord Bardolph. Tell thou the Earl
       That the Lord Bardolph doth attend him here.

     * Porter. His lordship is walk'd forth into the orchard.
       Please it your honour knock but at the gate, 50
       And he himself will answer.

   Enter NORTHUMBERLAND
     * Lord Bardolph. Here comes the Earl. Exit PORTER

     * Earl of Northumberland. What news, Lord Bardolph? Every minute now
       Should be the father of some stratagem. 55
       The times are wild; contention, like a horse
       Full of high feeding, madly hath broke loose
       And bears down all before him.

     * Lord Bardolph. Noble Earl,
       I bring you certain news from Shrewsbury. 60

     * Earl of Northumberland. Good, an God will!

     * Lord Bardolph. As good as heart can wish.
       The King is almost wounded to the death;
       And, in the fortune of my lord your son,
       Prince Harry slain outright; and both the Blunts 65
       Kill'd by the hand of Douglas; young Prince John,
       And Westmoreland, and Stafford, fled the field;
       And Harry Monmouth's brawn, the hulk Sir John,
       Is prisoner to your son. O, such a day,
       So fought, so followed, and so fairly won, 70
       Came not till now to dignify the times,
       Since Cxsar's fortunes!

     * Earl of Northumberland. How is this deriv'd?
       Saw you the field? Came you from Shrewsbury?

     * Lord Bardolph. I spake with one, my lord, that came from 75
       A gentleman well bred and of good name,
       That freely rend'red me these news for true.

   Enter TRAVERS
     * Earl of Northumberland. Here comes my servant Travers, whom I sent
       80
       On Tuesday last to listen after news.

     * Lord Bardolph. My lord, I over-rode him on the way;
       And he is furnish'd with no certainties
       More than he haply may retail from me.

     * Earl of Northumberland. Now, Travers, what good tidings comes with
       you? 85

     * Travers. My lord, Sir John Umfrevile turn'd me back
       With joyful tidings; and, being better hors'd,
       Out-rode me. After him came spurring hard
       A gentleman, almost forspent with speed,
       That stopp'd by me to breathe his bloodied horse. 90
       He ask'd the way to Chester; and of him
       I did demand what news from Shrewsbury.
       He told me that rebellion had bad luck,
       And that young Harry Percy's spur was cold.
       With that he gave his able horse the head 95
       And, bending forward, struck his armed heels
       Against the panting sides of his poor jade
       Up to the rowel-head; and starting so,
       He seem'd in running to devour the way,
       Staying no longer question. 100

     * Earl of Northumberland. Ha! Again:
       Said he young Harry Percy's spur was cold?
       Of Hotspur, Coldspur? that rebellion
       Had met ill luck?

     * Lord Bardolph. My lord, I'll tell you what: 105
       If my young lord your son have not the day,
       Upon mine honour, for a silken point
       I'll give my barony. Never talk of it.

     * Earl of Northumberland. Why should that gentleman that rode by
       Travers
       Give then such instances of loss? 110

     * Lord Bardolph. Who—he?
       He was some hilding fellow that had stol'n
       The horse he rode on and, upon my life,
       Spoke at a venture. Look, here comes more news.

   Enter Morton
     * Earl of Northumberland. Yea, this man's brow, like to a title-leaf,
       Foretells the nature of a tragic volume.
       So looks the strand whereon the imperious flood
       Hath left a witness'd usurpation.
       Say, Morton, didst thou come from Shrewsbury? 120

     * Morton. I ran from Shrewsbury, my noble lord;
       Where hateful death put on his ugliest mask
       To fright our party.

     * Earl of Northumberland. How doth my son and brother?
       Thou tremblest; and the whiteness in thy cheek 125
       Is apter than thy tongue to tell thy errand.
       Even such a man, so faint, so spiritless,
       So dull, so dread in look, so woe-begone,
       Drew Priam's curtain in the dead of night
       And would have told him half his Troy was burnt; 130
       But Priam found the fire ere he his tongue,
       And I my Percy's death ere thou report'st it.
       This thou wouldst say: 'Your son did thus and thus;
       Your brother thus; so fought the noble Douglas'—
       Stopping my greedy ear with their bold deeds; 135
       But in the end, to stop my ear indeed,
       Thou hast a sigh to blow away this praise,
       Ending with 'Brother, son, and all, are dead.'

     * Morton. Douglas is living, and your brother, yet;
       But for my lord your son— 140

     * Earl of Northumberland. Why, he is dead.
       See what a ready tongue suspicion hath!
       He that but fears the thing he would not know
       Hath by instinct knowledge from others' eyes
       That what he fear'd is chanced. Yet speak, Morton; 145
       Tell thou an earl his divination lies,
       And I will take it as a sweet disgrace
       And make thee rich for doing me such wrong.

     * Morton. You are too great to be by me gainsaid;
       Your spirit is too true, your fears too certain. 150

     * Earl of Northumberland. Yet, for all this, say not that Percy's
       dead.
       I see a strange confession in thine eye;
       Thou shak'st thy head, and hold'st it fear or sin
       To speak a truth. If he be slain, say so:
       The tongue offends not that reports his death; 155
       And he doth sin that doth belie the dead,
       Not he which says the dead is not alive.
       Yet the first bringer of unwelcome news
       Hath but a losing office, and his tongue
       Sounds ever after as a sullen bell, 160
       Rememb'red tolling a departing friend.

     * Lord Bardolph. I cannot think, my lord, your son is dead.

     * Morton. I am sorry I should force you to believe
       That which I would to God I had not seen;
       But these mine eyes saw him in bloody state, 165
       Rend'ring faint quittance, wearied and out-breath'd,
       To Harry Monmouth, whose swift wrath beat down
       The never-daunted Percy to the earth,
       From whence with life he never more sprung up.
       In few, his death—whose spirit lent a fire 170
       Even to the dullest peasant in his camp—
       Being bruited once, took fire and heat away
       From the best-temper'd courage in his troops;
       For from his metal was his party steeled;
       Which once in him abated, all the rest 175
       Turn'd on themselves, like dull and heavy lead.
       And as the thing that's heavy in itself
       Upon enforcement flies with greatest speed,
       So did our men, heavy in Hotspur's loss,
       Lend to this weight such lightness with their fear 180
       That arrows fled not swifter toward their aim
       Than did our soldiers, aiming at their safety,
       Fly from the field. Then was that noble Worcester
       Too soon ta'en prisoner; and that furious Scot,
       The bloody Douglas, whose well-labouring sword 185
       Had three times slain th' appearance of the King,
       Gan vail his stomach and did grace the shame
       Of those that turn'd their backs, and in his flight,
       Stumbling in fear, was took. The sum of all
       Is that the King hath won, and hath sent out 190
       A speedy power to encounter you, my lord,
       Under the conduct of young Lancaster
       And Westmoreland. This is the news at full.

     * Earl of Northumberland. For this I shall have time enough to mourn.
       In poison there is physic; and these news, 195
       Having been well, that would have made me sick,
       Being sick, have in some measure made me well;
       And as the wretch whose fever-weak'ned joints,
       Like strengthless hinges, buckle under life,
       Impatient of his fit, breaks like a fire 200
       Out of his keeper's arms, even so my limbs,
       Weak'ned with grief, being now enrag'd with grief,
       Are thrice themselves. Hence, therefore, thou nice crutch!
       A scaly gauntlet now with joints of steel
       Must glove this hand; and hence, thou sickly coif! 205
       Thou art a guard too wanton for the head
       Which princes, flesh'd with conquest, aim to hit.
       Now bind my brows with iron; and approach
       The ragged'st hour that time and spite dare bring
       To frown upon th' enrag'd Northumberland! 210
       Let heaven kiss earth! Now let not Nature's hand
       Keep the wild flood confin'd! Let order die!
       And let this world no longer be a stage
       To feed contention in a ling'ring act;
       But let one spirit of the first-born Cain 215
       Reign in all bosoms, that, each heart being set
       On bloody courses, the rude scene may end
       And darkness be the burier of the dead!

     * Lord Bardolph. This strained passion doth you wrong, my lord.

     * Morton. Sweet Earl, divorce not wisdom from your honour. 220
       The lives of all your loving complices
       Lean on your health; the which, if you give o'er
       To stormy passion, must perforce decay.
       You cast th' event of war, my noble lord,
       And summ'd the account of chance before you said 225
       'Let us make head.' It was your pre-surmise
       That in the dole of blows your son might drop.
       You knew he walk'd o'er perils on an edge,
       More likely to fall in than to get o'er;
       You were advis'd his flesh was capable 230
       Of wounds and scars, and that his forward spirit
       Would lift him where most trade of danger rang'd;
       Yet did you say 'Go forth'; and none of this,
       Though strongly apprehended, could restrain
       The stiff-borne action. What hath then befall'n, 235
       Or what hath this bold enterprise brought forth
       More than that being which was like to be?

     * Lord Bardolph. We all that are engaged to this loss
       Knew that we ventured on such dangerous seas
       That if we wrought out life 'twas ten to one; 240
       And yet we ventur'd, for the gain propos'd
       Chok'd the respect of likely peril fear'd;
       And since we are o'erset, venture again.
       Come, we will put forth, body and goods.

     * Morton. 'Tis more than time. And, my most noble lord, 245
       I hear for certain, and dare speak the truth:
       The gentle Archbishop of York is up
       With well-appointed pow'rs. He is a man
       Who with a double surety binds his followers.
       My lord your son had only but the corpse, 250
       But shadows and the shows of men, to fight;
       For that same word 'rebellion' did divide
       The action of their bodies from their souls;
       And they did fight with queasiness, constrain'd,
       As men drink potions; that their weapons only 255
       Seem'd on our side, but for their spirits and souls
       This word 'rebellion'—it had froze them up,
       As fish are in a pond. But now the Bishop
       Turns insurrection to religion.
       Suppos'd sincere and holy in his thoughts, 260
       He's follow'd both with body and with mind;
       And doth enlarge his rising with the blood
       Of fair King Richard, scrap'd from Pomfret stones;
       Derives from heaven his quarrel and his cause;
       Tells them he doth bestride a bleeding land, 265
       Gasping for life under great Bolingbroke;
       And more and less do flock to follow him.

     * Earl of Northumberland. I knew of this before; but, to speak truth,
       This present grief had wip'd it from my mind.
       Go in with me; and counsel every man 270
       The aptest way for safety and revenge.
       Get posts and letters, and make friends with speed—
       Never so few, and never yet more need. Exeunt

   Act I, Scene 2

   London. A street
   _______________________________________________________________________

   Enter SIR JOHN FALSTAFF, with his PAGE bearing his sword and buckler
     * Falstaff. Sirrah, you giant, what says the doctor to my water? 275

     * Page. He said, sir, the water itself was a good healthy water;
       for the party that owed it, he might have moe diseases than
       knew for.

     * Falstaff. Men of all sorts take a pride to gird at me. The
       this foolish-compounded clay, man, is not able to invent
       that intends to laughter, more than I invent or is invented
       me. I am not only witty in myself, but the cause that wit is
       other men. I do here walk before thee like a sow that hath 285
       overwhelm'd all her litter but one. If the Prince put thee
       my service for any other reason than to set me off, why then
       have no judgment. Thou whoreson mandrake, thou art fitter to
       worn in my cap than to wait at my heels. I was never mann'd
       an agate till now; but I will inset you neither in gold nor 290
       silver, but in vile apparel, and send you back again to your
       master, for a jewel—the juvenal, the Prince your master,
       chin is not yet fledge. I will sooner have a beard grow in
       palm of my hand than he shall get one off his cheek; and yet
       will not stick to say his face is a face-royal. God may 295
       when he will, 'tis not a hair amiss yet. He may keep it still
       a face-royal, for a barber shall never earn sixpence out of
       and yet he'll be crowing as if he had writ man ever since his
       father was a bachelor. He may keep his own grace, but he's
       out of mine, I can assure him. What said Master Dommelton 300
       the satin for my short cloak and my slops?

     * Page. He said, sir, you should procure him better assurance
       Bardolph. He would not take his band and yours; he liked not
       security. 320

     * Falstaff. Let him be damn'd, like the Glutton; pray God his
       be hotter! A whoreson Achitophel! A rascal-yea-forsooth
       bear a gentleman in hand, and then stand upon security! The 325
       whoreson smooth-pates do now wear nothing but high shoes, and
       bunches of keys at their girdles; and if a man is through
       them in honest taking-up, then they must stand upon security.
       had as lief they would put ratsbane in my mouth as offer to
       it with security. I look'd 'a should have sent me two and 330
       yards of satin, as I am a true knight, and he sends me
       Well, he may sleep in security; for he hath the horn of
       abundance, and the lightness of his wife shines through it;
       yet cannot he see, though he have his own lanthorn to light
       Where's Bardolph? 335

     * Page. He's gone into Smithfield to buy your worship horse. 345

     * Falstaff. I bought him in Paul's, and he'll buy me a horse in
       Smithfield. An I could get me but a wife in the stews, I were
       mann'd, hors'd, and wiv'd.

   Enter the LORD CHIEF JUSTICE and SERVANT
     * Page. Sir, here comes the nobleman that committed the 350
       Prince for striking him about Bardolph.

     * Falstaff. Wait close; I will not see him.

     * Lord Chief Justice. What's he that goes there?

     * Servant. Falstaff, an't please your lordship.

     * Lord Chief Justice. He that was in question for the robb'ry? 355

     * Servant. He, my lord; but he hath since done good service at
       Shrewsbury, and, as I hear, is now going with some charge to
       Lord John of Lancaster.

     * Lord Chief Justice. What, to York? Call him back again. 360

     * Servant. Sir John Falstaff!

     * Falstaff. Boy, tell him I am deaf.

     * Page. You must speak louder; my master is deaf.

     * Lord Chief Justice. I am sure he is, to the hearing of anything
       Go, pluck him by the elbow; I must speak with him. 365

     * Servant. Sir John!

     * Falstaff. What! a young knave, and begging! Is there not wars?
       there not employment? Doth not the King lack subjects? Do not
       rebels need soldiers? Though it be a shame to be on any side 370
       one, it is worse shame to beg than to be on the worst side,
       it worse than the name of rebellion can tell how to make it.

     * Servant. You mistake me, sir.

     * Falstaff. Why, sir, did I say you were an honest man? Setting
       knighthood and my soldiership aside, I had lied in my throat
       had said so. 380

     * Servant. I pray you, sir, then set your knighthood and your
       soldiership aside; and give me leave to tell you you in your
       throat, if you say I am any other than an honest man. 385

     * Falstaff. I give thee leave to tell me so! I lay aside that
       grows to me! If thou get'st any leave of me, hang me; if thou
       tak'st leave, thou wert better be hang'd. You hunt counter.
       Hence! Avaunt!

     * Servant. Sir, my lord would speak with you.

     * Lord Chief Justice. Sir John Falstaff, a word with you.

     * Falstaff. My good lord! God give your lordship good time of
       am glad to see your lordship abroad. I heard say your
       was sick; I hope your lordship goes abroad by advice. Your 395
       lordship, though not clean past your youth, hath yet some
       of age in you, some relish of the saltness of time; and I
       humbly beseech your lordship to have a reverend care of your
       health.

     * Lord Chief Justice. Sir John, I sent for you before your expedition
       Shrewsbury. 405

     * Falstaff. An't please your lordship, I hear his Majesty is
       with some discomfort from Wales.

     * Lord Chief Justice. I talk not of his Majesty. You would not come
       410
       sent for you.

     * Falstaff. And I hear, moreover, his Highness is fall'n into
       same whoreson apoplexy.

     * Lord Chief Justice. Well God mend him! I pray you let me speak with

     * Falstaff. This apoplexy, as I take it, is a kind of lethargy,
       please your lordship, a kind of sleeping in the blood, a
       tingling. 420

     * Lord Chief Justice. What tell you me of it? Be it as it is.

     * Falstaff. It hath it original from much grief, from study, and
       perturbation of the brain. I have read the cause of his 425
       in Galen; it is a kind of deafness.

     * Lord Chief Justice. I think you are fall'n into the disease, for
       you
       hear not what I say to you.

     * Falstaff. Very well, my lord, very well. Rather an't please 430
       is the disease of not listening, the malady of not marking,
       I am troubled withal.

     * Lord Chief Justice. To punish you by the heels would amend the 435
       of your ears; and I care not if I do become your physician.

     * Falstaff. I am as poor as Job, my lord, but not so patient.
       lordship may minister the potion of imprisonment to me in
       of poverty; but how I should be your patient to follow your 440
       prescriptions, the wise may make some dram of a scruple, or
       indeed a scruple itself.

     * Lord Chief Justice. I sent for you, when there were matters against
       445
       for your life, to come speak with me.

     * Falstaff. As I was then advis'd by my learned counsel in the
       of this land-service, I did not come.

     * Lord Chief Justice. Well, the truth is, Sir John, you live in great
       infamy.

     * Falstaff. He that buckles himself in my belt cannot live in

     * Lord Chief Justice. Your means are very slender, and your waste is
       455
       great.

     * Falstaff. I would it were otherwise; I would my means were
       and my waist slenderer.

     * Lord Chief Justice. You have misled the youthful Prince. 460

     * Falstaff. The young Prince hath misled me. I am the fellow with
       great belly, and he my dog.

     * Lord Chief Justice. Well, I am loath to gall a new-heal'd wound.
       day's service at Shrewsbury hath a little gilded over your 465
       night's exploit on Gadshill. You may thank th' unquiet time
       your quiet o'erposting that action.

     * Falstaff. My lord— 470

     * Lord Chief Justice. But since all is well, keep it so: wake not a
       sleeping wolf.

     * Falstaff. To wake a wolf is as bad as smell a fox.

     * Lord Chief Justice. What! you are as a candle, the better part
       burnt
       out. 475

     * Falstaff. A wassail candle, my lord—all tallow; if I did say
       wax, my growth would approve the truth.

     * Lord Chief Justice. There is not a white hair in your face but
       have his effect of gravity. 480

     * Falstaff. His effect of gravy, gravy,

     * Lord Chief Justice. You follow the young Prince up and down, like
       ill angel.

     * Falstaff. Not so, my lord. Your ill angel is light; but hope
       that looks upon me will take me without weighing. And yet in
       respects, I grant, I cannot go—I cannot tell. Virtue is of
       little regard in these costermongers' times that true valour
       turn'd berod; pregnancy is made a tapster, and his quick wit 490
       wasted in giving reckonings; all the other gifts appertinent
       man, as the malice of this age shapes them, are not worth a
       gooseberry. You that are old consider not the capacities of
       that are young; you do measure the heat of our livers with
       bitterness of your galls; and we that are in the vaward of 495
       youth, must confess, are wags too.

     * Lord Chief Justice. Do you set down your name in the scroll of 505
       that are written down old with all the characters of age?
       you not a moist eye, a dry hand, a yellow cheek, a white
       decreasing leg, an increasing belly? Is not your voice
       your wind short, your chin double, your wit single, and every
       part about you blasted with antiquity? And will you yet call 510
       yourself young? Fie, fie, fie, Sir John!

     * Falstaff. My lord, I was born about three of the clock in the
       afternoon, with a white head and something a round belly. For
       voice—I have lost it with hallooing and singing of anthems.
       approve my youth further, I will not. The truth is, I am only
       in judgment and understanding; and he that will caper with me 520
       a thousand marks, let him lend me the money, and have at him.
       the box of the ear that the Prince gave you—he gave it like
       rude prince, and you took it like a sensible lord. I have
       him for it; and the young lion repents—marry, not in ashes
       sackcloth, but in new silk and old sack. 525

     * Lord Chief Justice. Well, God send the Prince a better companion!

     * Falstaff. God send the companion a better prince! I cannot rid 535
       hands of him.

     * Lord Chief Justice. Well, the King hath sever'd you. I hear you are
       going with Lord John of Lancaster against the Archbishop and
       Earl of Northumberland. 540

     * Falstaff. Yea; I thank your pretty sweet wit for it. But look
       pray, all you that kiss my Lady Peace at home, that our
       join not in a hot day; for, by the Lord, I take but two
       out with me, and I mean not to sweat extraordinarily. If it 545
       hot day, and I brandish anything but a bottle, I would I
       never spit white again. There is not a dangerous action can
       out his head but I am thrust upon it. Well, I cannot last
       but it was alway yet the trick of our English nation, if they
       have a good thing, to make it too common. If ye will needs 550
       am an old man, you should give me rest. I would to God my
       were not so terrible to the enemy as it is. I were better to
       eaten to death with a rust than to be scoured to nothing with
       perpetual motion.

     * Lord Chief Justice. Well, be honest, be honest; and God bless your
       565
       expedition!

     * Falstaff. Will your lordship lend me a thousand pound to
       forth?

     * Lord Chief Justice. Not a penny, not a penny; you are too impatient
       570
       bear crosses. Fare you well. Commend me to my cousin
       Westmoreland.

   Exeunt CHIEF JUSTICE and SERVANT
     * Falstaff. If I do, fillip me with a three-man beetle. A man can 575
       more separate age and covetousness than 'a can part young
       and lechery; but the gout galls the one, and the pox pinches
       other; and so both the degrees prevent my curses. Boy!

     * Page. Sir?

     * Falstaff. What money is in my purse?

     * Page. Seven groats and two pence.

     * Falstaff. I can get no remedy against this consumption of the 585
       purse; borrowing only lingers and lingers it out, but the
       is incurable. Go bear this letter to my Lord of Lancaster;
       to the Prince; this to the Earl of Westmoreland; and this to
       Mistress Ursula, whom I have weekly sworn to marry since I
       perceiv'd the first white hair of my chin. About it; you know 590
       where to find me. [Exit PAGE] A pox of this gout! or, a
       this pox! for the one or the other plays the rogue with my
       toe. 'Tis no matter if I do halt; I have the wars for my
       and my pension shall seem the more reasonable. A good wit
       make use of anything. I will turn diseases to commodity. 595

   Act I, Scene 3

   York. The ARCHBISHOP’S palace
   _______________________________________________________________________

   Enter the ARCHBISHOP, THOMAS MOWBRAY the EARL MARSHAL, LORD HASTINGS,
   and LORD BARDOLPH
     * Archbishop Scroop. Thus have you heard our cause and known our
       means; 605
       And, my most noble friends, I pray you all
       Speak plainly your opinions of our hopes-
       And first, Lord Marshal, what say you to it?

     * Lord Mowbray. I well allow the occasion of our amis;
       But gladly would be better satisfied 610
       How, in our means, we should advance ourselves
       To look with forehead bold and big enough
       Upon the power and puissance of the King.

     * Lord Hastings. Our present musters grow upon the file
       To five and twenty thousand men of choice; 615
       And our supplies live largely in the hope
       Of great Northumberland, whose bosom burns
       With an incensed fire of injuries.

     * Lord Bardolph. The question then, Lord Hastings, standeth thus:
       Whether our present five and twenty thousand 620
       May hold up head without Northumberland?

     * Lord Hastings. With him, we may.

     * Lord Bardolph. Yea, marry, there's the point;
       But if without him we be thought too feeble,
       My judgment is we should not step too far 625
       Till we had his assistance by the hand;
       For, in a theme so bloody-fac'd as this,
       Conjecture, expectation, and surmise
       Of aids incertain, should not be admitted.

     * Archbishop Scroop. 'Tis very true, Lord Bardolph; for indeed 630
       It was young Hotspur's case at Shrewsbury.

     * Lord Bardolph. It was, my lord; who lin'd himself with hope,
       Eating the air and promise of supply,
       Flatt'ring himself in project of a power
       Much smaller than the smallest of his thoughts; 635
       And so, with great imagination
       Proper to madmen, led his powers to death,
       And, winking, leapt into destruction.

     * Lord Hastings. But, by your leave, it never yet did hurt
       To lay down likelihoods and forms of hope. 640

     * Lord Bardolph. Yes, if this present quality of war-
       Indeed the instant action, a cause on foot-
       Lives so in hope, as in an early spring
       We see th' appearing buds; which to prove fruit
       Hope gives not so much warrant, as despair 645
       That frosts will bite them. When we mean to build,
       We first survey the plot, then draw the model;
       And when we see the figure of the house,
       Then we must rate the cost of the erection;
       Which if we find outweighs ability, 650
       What do we then but draw anew the model
       In fewer offices, or at least desist
       To build at all? Much more, in this great work—
       Which is almost to pluck a kingdom down
       And set another up—should we survey 655
       The plot of situation and the model,
       Consent upon a sure foundation,
       Question surveyors, know our own estate
       How able such a work to undergo-
       To weigh against his opposite; or else 660
       We fortify in paper and in figures,
       Using the names of men instead of men;
       Like one that draws the model of a house
       Beyond his power to build it; who, half through,
       Gives o'er and leaves his part-created cost 665
       A naked subject to the weeping clouds
       And waste for churlish winter's tyranny.

     * Lord Hastings. Grant that our hopes—yet likely of fair birth—
       Should be still-born, and that we now possess'd
       The utmost man of expectation, 670
       I think we are so a body strong enough,
       Even as we are, to equal with the King.

     * Lord Bardolph. What, is the King but five and twenty thousand?

     * Lord Hastings. To us no more; nay, not so much, Lord Bardolph;
       For his divisions, as the times do brawl, 675
       Are in three heads: one power against the French,
       And one against Glendower; perforce a third
       Must take up us. So is the unfirm King
       In three divided; and his coffers sound
       With hollow poverty and emptiness. 680

     * Archbishop Scroop. That he should draw his several strengths
       together
       And come against us in full puissance
       Need not be dreaded.

     * Lord Hastings. If he should do so,
       He leaves his back unarm'd, the French and Welsh 685
       Baying at his heels. Never fear that.

     * Lord Bardolph. Who is it like should lead his forces hither?

     * Lord Hastings. The Duke of Lancaster and Westmoreland;
       Against the Welsh, himself and Harry Monmouth;
       But who is substituted against the French 690
       I have no certain notice.

     * Archbishop Scroop. Let us on,
       And publish the occasion of our arms.
       The commonwealth is sick of their own choice;
       Their over-greedy love hath surfeited. 695
       An habitation giddy and unsure
       Hath he that buildeth on the vulgar heart.
       O thou fond many, with what loud applause
       Didst thou beat heaven with blessing Bolingbroke
       Before he was what thou wouldst have him be! 700
       And being now trimm'd in thine own desires,
       Thou, beastly feeder, art so full of him
       That thou provok'st thyself to cast him up.
       So, so, thou common dog, didst thou disgorge
       Thy glutton bosom of the royal Richard; 705
       And now thou wouldst eat thy dead vomit up,
       And howl'st to find it. What trust is in these times?
       They that, when Richard liv'd, would have him die
       Are now become enamour'd on his grave.
       Thou that threw'st dust upon his goodly head, 710
       When through proud London he came sighing on
       After th' admired heels of Bolingbroke,
       Criest now 'O earth, yield us that king again,
       And take thou this!' O thoughts of men accurs'd!
       Past and to come seems best; things present, worst. 715

     * Lord Mowbray. Shall we go draw our numbers, and set on?

     * Lord Hastings. We are time's subjects, and time bids be gone.

   Exeunt

   Act II, Scene 1

   London. A street
   _______________________________________________________________________

   Enter HOSTESS with two officers, FANG and SNARE
     * Hostess Quickly. Master Fang, have you ent'red the action? 720

     * Fang. It is ent'red.

     * Hostess Quickly. Where's your yeoman? Is't a lusty yeoman? Will 'a
       to't?

     * Fang. Sirrah, where's Snare? 725

     * Hostess Quickly. O Lord, ay! good Master Snare.

     * Snare. Here, here.

     * Fang. Snare, we must arrest Sir John Falstaff.

     * Hostess Quickly. Yea, good Master Snare; I have ent'red him and
       all.

     * Snare. It may chance cost some of our lives, for he will stab. 730

     * Hostess Quickly. Alas the day! take heed of him; he stabb'd me in
       mine
       house, and that most beastly. In good faith, 'a cares not
       mischief he does, if his weapon be out; he will foin like any
       devil; he will spare neither man, woman, nor child.

     * Fang. If I can close with him, I care not for his thrust.

     * Hostess Quickly. No, nor I neither; I'll be at your elbow.

     * Fang. An I but fist him once; an 'a come but within my vice!

     * Hostess Quickly. I am undone by his going; I warrant you, he's an
       740
       infinitive thing upon my score. Good Master Fang, hold him
       Good Master Snare, let him not scape. 'A comes continuantly
       Pie-corner—saving your manhoods—to buy a saddle; and he is
       indited to dinner to the Lubber's Head in Lumbert Street, to
       Master Smooth's the silkman. I pray you, since my exion is 745
       ent'red, and my case so openly known to the world, let him be
       brought in to his answer. A hundred mark is a long one for a
       lone woman to bear; and I have borne, and borne, and borne;
       have been fubb'd off, and fubb'd off, and fubb'd off, from
       day to that day, that it is a shame to be thought on. There 750
       honesty in such dealing; unless a woman should be made an ass
       a beast, to bear every knave's wrong.
       [Enter SIR JOHN FALSTAFF, PAGE, and BARDOLPH]
       Yonder he comes; and that arrant malmsey-nose knave,
       with him. Do your offices, do your offices, Master Fang and 755
       Master Snare; do me, do me, do me your offices.

     * Falstaff. How now! whose mare's dead? What's the matter? 765

     * Fang. Sir John, I arrest you at the suit of Mistress Quickly.

     * Falstaff. Away, varlets! Draw, Bardolph. Cut me off the
       head. Throw the quean in the channel.

     * Hostess Quickly. Throw me in the channel! I'll throw thee in the
       770
       Wilt thou? wilt thou? thou bastardly rogue! Murder, murder!
       thou honeysuckle villain! wilt thou kill God's officers and
       King's? Ah, thou honey-seed rogue! thou art a honey-seed; a
       man-queller and a woman-queller.

     * Falstaff. Keep them off, Bardolph.

     * Fang. A rescue! a rescue!

     * Hostess Quickly. Good people, bring a rescue or two. Thou wot, wot
       780
       thou wot, wot ta? Do, do, thou rogue! do, thou hemp-seed!

     * Page. Away, you scullion! you rampallian! you fustilarian!
       I'll tickle your catastrophe.

   Enter the LORD CHIEF JUSTICE and his men
     * Lord Chief Justice. What is the matter? Keep the peace here, ho!

     * Hostess Quickly. Good my lord, be good to me. I beseech you, stand
       to

     * Lord Chief Justice. How now, Sir John! what, are you brawling here?
       Doth this become your place, your time, and business? 790
       You should have been well on your way to York.
       Stand from him, fellow; wherefore hang'st thou upon him?

     * Hostess Quickly. O My most worshipful lord, an't please your Grace,
       I
       poor widow of Eastcheap, and he is arrested at my suit.

     * Lord Chief Justice. For what sum?

     * Hostess Quickly. It is more than for some, my lord; it is for
       all—all
       have. He hath eaten me out of house and home; he hath put all
       substance into that fat belly of his. But I will have some of
       out again, or I will ride thee a nights like a mare. 800

     * Falstaff. I think I am as like to ride the mare, if I have any
       vantage of ground to get up. 805

     * Lord Chief Justice. How comes this, Sir John? Fie! What man of good
       temper would endure this tempest of exclamation? Are you not
       ashamed to enforce a poor widow to so rough a course to come
       her own?

     * Falstaff. What is the gross sum that I owe thee?

     * Hostess Quickly. Marry, if thou wert an honest man, thyself and the
       too. Thou didst swear to me upon a parcel-gilt goblet,
       my Dolphin chamber, at the round table, by a sea-coal fire,
       Wednesday in Wheeson week, when the Prince broke thy head for 815
       liking his father to singing-man of Windsor—thou didst swear
       me then, as I was washing thy wound, to marry me and make me
       lady thy wife. Canst thou deny it? Did not goodwife Keech,
       butcher's wife, come in then and call me gossip Quickly?
       in to borrow a mess of vinegar, telling us she had a good 820
       prawns, whereby thou didst desire to eat some, whereby I told
       thee they were ill for green wound? And didst thou not, when
       was gone down stairs, desire me to be no more so familiarity
       such poor people, saying that ere long they should call me
       And didst thou not kiss me, and bid me fetch the thirty 825
       shillings? I put thee now to thy book-oath. Deny it, if thou
       canst.

     * Falstaff. My lord, this is a poor mad soul, and she says up and
       down the town that her eldest son is like you. She hath been 840
       good case, and, the truth is, poverty hath distracted her.
       for these foolish officers, I beseech you I may have redress
       against them.

     * Lord Chief Justice. Sir John, Sir John, I am well acquainted with
       manner of wrenching the true cause the false way. It is not a
       confident brow, nor the throng of words that come with such
       than impudent sauciness from you, can thrust me from a level
       consideration. You have, as it appears to me, practis'd upon 850
       easy yielding spirit of this woman, and made her serve your
       both in purse and in person.

     * Hostess Quickly. Yea, in truth, my lord.

     * Lord Chief Justice. Pray thee, peace. Pay her the debt you owe her,
       unpay the villainy you have done with her; the one you may do
       with sterling money, and the other with current repentance. 860

     * Falstaff. My lord, I will not undergo this sneap without reply.
       call honourable boldness impudent sauciness; if a man will
       curtsy and say nothing, he is virtuous. No, my lord, my
       duty rememb'red, I will not be your suitor. I say to you I do 865
       desire deliverance from these officers, being upon hasty
       employment in the King's affairs.

     * Lord Chief Justice. You speak as having power to do wrong; but
       th' effect of your reputation, and satisfy the poor woman.

     * Falstaff. Come hither, hostess.

   Enter GOWER
     * Lord Chief Justice. Now, Master Gower, what news?

     * Gower. The King, my lord, and Harry Prince of Wales
       Are near at hand. The rest the paper tells. [Gives a letter]

     * Falstaff. As I am a gentleman!

     * Hostess Quickly. Faith, you said so before. 880

     * Falstaff. As I am a gentleman! Come, no more words of it.

     * Hostess Quickly. By this heavenly ground I tread on, I must be fain
       to
       both my plate and the tapestry of my dining-chambers.

     * Falstaff. Glasses, glasses, is the only drinking; and for thy 885
       walls, a pretty slight drollery, or the story of the
       the German hunting, in water-work, is worth a thousand of
       bed-hangers and these fly-bitten tapestries. Let it be ten
       if thou canst. Come, and 'twere not for thy humours, there's
       a better wench in England. Go, wash thy face, and draw the 890
       action. Come, thou must not be in this humour with me; dost
       know me? Come, come, I know thou wast set on to this.

     * Hostess Quickly. Pray thee, Sir John, let it be but twenty nobles;
       i' faith, I am loath to pawn my plate, so God save me, la!

     * Falstaff. Let it alone; I'll make other shift. You'll be a fool 900
       still.

     * Hostess Quickly. Well, you shall have it, though I pawn my gown.
       I hope you'll come to supper. you'll pay me all together?

     * Falstaff. Will I live? [To BARDOLPH] Go, with her, with her;
       on, hook on. 905

     * Hostess Quickly. Will you have Doll Tearsheet meet you at supper?

     * Falstaff. No more words; let's have her.

   Exeunt HOSTESS, BARDOLPH, and OFFICERS
     * Lord Chief Justice. I have heard better news. 910

     * Falstaff. What's the news, my lord?

     * Lord Chief Justice. Where lay the King to-night?

     * Gower. At Basingstoke, my lord.

     * Falstaff. I hope, my lord, all's well. What is the news, my

     * Lord Chief Justice. Come all his forces back?

     * Gower. No; fifteen hundred foot, five hundred horse,
       Are march'd up to my Lord of Lancaster,
       Against Northumberland and the Archbishop.

     * Falstaff. Comes the King back from Wales, my noble lord? 920

     * Lord Chief Justice. You shall have letters of me presently.
       Come, go along with me, good Master Gower.

     * Falstaff. My lord!

     * Lord Chief Justice. What's the matter?

     * Falstaff. Master Gower, shall I entreat you with me to dinner? 925

     * Gower. I must wait upon my good lord here, I thank you, good
       John.

     * Lord Chief Justice. Sir John, you loiter here too long, being you
       take soldiers up in counties as you go. 930

     * Falstaff. Will you sup with me, Master Gower?

     * Lord Chief Justice. What foolish master taught you these manners,
       John?

     * Falstaff. Master Gower, if they become me not, he was a fool
       taught them me. This is the right fencing grace, my lord; tap
       tap, and so part fair.

     * Lord Chief Justice. Now, the Lord lighten thee! Thou art a great

   Act II, Scene 2

   London. Another street
   _______________________________________________________________________

   Enter PRINCE HENRY and POINS
     * Henry V. Before God, I am exceeding weary. 945

     * Edward Poins. Is't come to that? I had thought weariness durst not
       attach'd one of so high blood.

     * Henry V. Faith, it does me; though it discolours the complexion
       my greatness to acknowledge it. Doth it not show vilely in me 950
       desire small beer?

     * Edward Poins. Why, a prince should not be so loosely studied as to
       remember so weak a composition. 955

     * Henry V. Belike then my appetite was not-princely got; for, by
       troth, I do now remember the poor creature, small beer. But
       indeed these humble considerations make me out of love with
       greatness. What a disgrace is it to me to remember thy name,
       to know thy face to-morrow, or to take note how many pair of 960
       stockings thou hast—viz., these, and those that were thy
       peach-colour'd ones—or to bear the inventory of thy shirts-
       one for superfluity, and another for use! But that the
       tennis-court-keeper knows better than I; for it is a low ebb
       linen with thee when thou keepest not racket there; as thou 965
       not done a great while, because the rest of thy low countries
       have made a shift to eat up thy holland. And God knows
       those that bawl out of the ruins of thy linen shall inherit
       kingdom; but the midwives say the children are not in the
       whereupon the world increases, and kindreds are mightily 970
       strengthened.

     * Edward Poins. How ill it follows, after you have laboured so hard,
       you
       should talk so idly! Tell me, how many good young princes
       do so, their fathers being so sick as yours at this time is?

     * Henry V. Shall I tell thee one thing, Poins?

     * Edward Poins. Yes, faith; and let it be an excellent good thing.

     * Henry V. It shall serve among wits of no higher breeding than

     * Edward Poins. Go to; I stand the push of your one thing that you
       will 990
       tell.

     * Henry V. Marry, I tell thee it is not meet that I should be sad,
       my father is sick; albeit I could tell to thee—as to one it
       pleases me, for fault of a better, to call my friend—I could
       sad and sad indeed too. 995

     * Edward Poins. Very hardly upon such a subject.

     * Henry V. By this hand, thou thinkest me as far in the devil's
       as thou and Falstaff for obduracy and persistency: let the 1000
       try the man. But I tell thee my heart bleeds inwardly that my
       father is so sick; and keeping such vile company as thou art
       in reason taken from me all ostentation of sorrow.

     * Edward Poins. The reason?

     * Henry V. What wouldst thou think of me if I should weep?

     * Edward Poins. I would think thee a most princely hypocrite.

     * Henry V. It would be every man's thought; and thou art a blessed
       1010
       fellow to think as every man thinks. Never a man's thought in
       world keeps the road-way better than thine. Every man would
       me an hypocrite indeed. And what accites your most worshipful
       thought to think so?

     * Edward Poins. Why, because you have been so lewd and so much
       engraffed
       Falstaff.

     * Henry V. And to thee. 1020

     * Edward Poins. By this light, I am well spoke on; I can hear it with
       own ears. The worst that they can say of me is that I am a
       brother and that I am a proper fellow of my hands; and those
       things, I confess, I cannot help. By the mass, here comes
       Bardolph. 1025

   Enter BARDOLPH and PAGE
     * Henry V. And the boy that I gave Falstaff. 'A had him from me 1030
       Christian; and look if the fat villain have not transform'd
       ape.

     * Bardolph. God save your Grace!

     * Henry V. And yours, most noble Bardolph! 1035

     * Edward Poins. Come, you virtuous ass, you bashful fool, must you be
       blushing? Wherefore blush you now? What a maidenly
       are you become! Is't such a matter to get a pottle-pot's
       maidenhead?

     * Page. 'A calls me e'en now, my lord, through a red lattice, and
       could discern no part of his face from the window. At last I
       spied his eyes; and methought he had made two holes in the
       alewife's new petticoat, and so peep'd through.

     * Henry V. Has not the boy profited?

     * Bardolph. Away, you whoreson upright rabbit, away!

     * Page. Away, you rascally Althaea's dream, away!

     * Henry V. Instruct us, boy; what dream, boy?

     * Page. Marry, my lord, Althaea dreamt she was delivered of a 1050
       firebrand; and therefore I call him her dream.

     * Henry V. A crown's worth of good interpretation. There 'tis,

   [Giving a crown]
     * Edward Poins. O that this blossom could be kept from cankers! 1055
       Well, there is sixpence to preserve thee.

     * Bardolph. An you do not make him be hang'd among you, the
       shall have wrong.

     * Henry V. And how doth thy master, Bardolph? 1060

     * Bardolph. Well, my lord. He heard of your Grace's coming to
       There's a letter for you.

     * Edward Poins. Deliver'd with good respect. And how doth the
       martlemas,
       your master? 1065

     * Bardolph. In bodily health, sir.

     * Edward Poins. Marry, the immortal part needs a physician; but that
       not him. Though that be sick, it dies not.

     * Henry V. I do allow this well to be as familiar with me as my 1070
       and he holds his place, for look you how he writes.

     * Edward Poins. [Reads] 'John Falstaff, knight'—Every man must know
       as oft as he has occasion to name himself, even like those
       are kin to the King; for they never prick their finger but 1075
       say 'There's some of the King's blood spilt.' 'How comes
       says he that takes upon him not to conceive. The answer is as
       ready as a borrower's cap: 'I am the King's poor cousin,

     * Henry V. Nay, they will be kin to us, or they will fetch it from
       Japhet. But the letter: [Reads] 'Sir John Falstaff, knight, 1085
       the son of the King nearest his father, Harry Prince of
       greeting.'

     * Edward Poins. Why, this is a certificate. 1090

     * Henry V. Peace! [Reads] 'I will imitate the honourable Romans
       brevity.'-

     * Edward Poins. He sure means brevity in breath, short-winded.

     * Henry V. [Reads] 'I commend me to thee, I commend thee, and I 1095
       leave thee. Be not too familiar with Poins; for he misuses
       favours so much that he swears thou art to marry his sister
       Repent at idle times as thou mayst, and so farewell.
       Thine, by yea and no—which is as much as to say as
       thou usest him—JACK FALSTAFF with my familiars, 1100
       JOHN with my brothers and sisters, and SIR JOHN with
       all Europe.'

     * Edward Poins. My lord, I'll steep this letter in sack and make him
       eat 1105

     * Henry V. That's to make him eat twenty of his words. But do you
       me thus, Ned? Must I marry your sister?

     * Edward Poins. God send the wench no worse fortune! But I never said
       1110

     * Henry V. Well, thus we play the fools with the time, and the
       of the wise sit in the clouds and mock us. Is your master
       London?

     * Bardolph. Yea, my lord.

     * Henry V. Where sups he? Doth the old boar feed in the old frank?

     * Bardolph. At the old place, my lord, in Eastcheap.

     * Henry V. What company? 1120

     * Page. Ephesians, my lord, of the old church.

     * Henry V. Sup any women with him?

     * Page. None, my lord, but old Mistress Quickly and Mistress Doll
       Tearsheet.

     * Henry V. What pagan may that be? 1125

     * Page. A proper gentlewoman, sir, and a kinswoman of my

     * Henry V. Even such kin as the parish heifers are to the town
       Shall we steal upon them, Ned, at supper?

     * Edward Poins. I am your shadow, my lord; I'll follow you.

     * Henry V. Sirrah, you boy, and Bardolph, no word to your master
       I am yet come to town. There's for your silence.

     * Bardolph. I have no tongue, sir. 1135

     * Page. And for mine, sir, I will govern it.

     * Henry V. Fare you well; go. Exeunt BARDOLPH and PAGE
       This Doll Tearsheet should be some road.

     * Edward Poins. I warrant you, as common as the way between Saint
       Albans
       London. 1140

     * Henry V. How might we see Falstaff bestow himself to-night in
       true colours, and not ourselves be seen?

     * Edward Poins. Put on two leathern jerkins and aprons, and wait upon
       1145
       his table as drawers.

     * Henry V. From a god to a bull? A heavy descension! It was Jove's
       case. From a prince to a prentice? A low transformation! That
       shall be mine; for in everything the purpose must weigh with 1150
       folly. Follow me, Ned.

   Act II, Scene 3

   Warkworth. Before the castle
   _______________________________________________________________________

   Enter NORTHUMBERLAND, LADY NORTHUMBERLAND, and LADY PERCY
     * Earl of Northumberland. I pray thee, loving wife, and gentle
       daughter, 1155
       Give even way unto my rough affairs;
       Put not you on the visage of the times
       And be, like them, to Percy troublesome.

     * Lady Northumberland. I have given over, I will speak no more.
       Do what you will; your wisdom be your guide. 1160

     * Earl of Northumberland. Alas, sweet wife, my honour is at pawn;
       And but my going nothing can redeem it.

     * Lady Percy. O, yet, for God's sake, go not to these wars!
       The time was, father, that you broke your word,
       When you were more endear'd to it than now; 1165
       When your own Percy, when my heart's dear Harry,
       Threw many a northward look to see his father
       Bring up his powers; but he did long in vain.
       Who then persuaded you to stay at home?
       There were two honours lost, yours and your son's. 1170
       For yours, the God of heaven brighten it!
       For his, it stuck upon him as the sun
       In the grey vault of heaven; and by his light
       Did all the chivalry of England move
       To do brave acts. He was indeed the glass 1175
       Wherein the noble youth did dress themselves.
       He had no legs that practis'd not his gait;
       And speaking thick, which nature made his blemish,
       Became the accents of the valiant;
       For those who could speak low and tardily 1180
       Would turn their own perfection to abuse
       To seem like him: so that in speech, in gait,
       In diet, in affections of delight,
       In military rules, humours of blood,
       He was the mark and glass, copy and book, 1185
       That fashion'd others. And him—O wondrous him!
       O miracle of men!—him did you leave—
       Second to none, unseconded by you—
       To look upon the hideous god of war
       In disadvantage, to abide a field 1190
       Where nothing but the sound of Hotspur's name
       Did seem defensible. So you left him.
       Never, O never, do his ghost the wrong
       To hold your honour more precise and nice
       With others than with him! Let them alone. 1195
       The Marshal and the Archbishop are strong.
       Had my sweet Harry had but half their numbers,
       To-day might I, hanging on Hotspur's neck,
       Have talk'd of Monmouth's grave.

     * Earl of Northumberland. Beshrew your heart, 1200
       Fair daughter, you do draw my spirits from me
       With new lamenting ancient oversights.
       But I must go and meet with danger there,
       Or it will seek me in another place,
       And find me worse provided. 1205

     * Lady Northumberland. O, fly to Scotland
       Till that the nobles and the armed commons
       Have of their puissance made a little taste.

     * Lady Percy. If they get ground and vantage of the King,
       Then join you with them, like a rib of steel, 1210
       To make strength stronger; but, for all our loves,
       First let them try themselves. So did your son;
       He was so suff'red; so came I a widow;
       And never shall have length of life enough
       To rain upon remembrance with mine eyes, 1215
       That it may grow and sprout as high as heaven,
       For recordation to my noble husband.

     * Earl of Northumberland. Come, come, go in with me. 'Tis with my
       mind
       As with the tide swell'd up unto his height,
       That makes a still-stand, running neither way. 1220
       Fain would I go to meet the Archbishop,
       But many thousand reasons hold me back.
       I will resolve for Scotland. There am I,
       Till time and vantage crave my company. Exeunt

   Act II, Scene 4

   London. The Boar’s Head Tavern in Eastcheap
   _______________________________________________________________________

   Enter FRANCIS and another DRAWER
     * Francis. What the devil hast thou brought there-apple-johns?
       knowest Sir John cannot endure an apple-john.

     * Second Drawer. Mass, thou say'st true. The Prince once set a
       of apple-johns before him, and told him there were five more 1230
       Johns; and, putting off his hat, said 'I will now take my
       of these six dry, round, old, withered knights.' It ang'red
       to the heart; but he hath forgot that.

     * Francis. Why, then, cover and set them down; and see if thou
       find out Sneak's noise; Mistress Tearsheet would fain hear
       music. 1240

   Enter third DRAWER
     * Third Drawer. Dispatch! The room where they supp'd is too hot;
       they'll come in straight. 1245

     * Francis. Sirrah, here will be the Prince and Master Poins anon;
       they will put on two of our jerkins and aprons; and Sir John
       not know of it. Bardolph hath brought word.

     * Third Drawer. By the mass, here will be old uds; it will be an
       excellent stratagem.

     * Second Drawer. I'll see if I can find out Sneak.

   Exeunt second and third DRAWERS

   Enter HOSTESS and DOLL TEARSHEET
     * Hostess Quickly. I' faith, sweetheart, methinks now you are in an
       good temperality. Your pulsidge beats as extraordinarily as
       would desire; and your colour, I warrant you, is as red as
       rose, in good truth, la! But, i' faith, you have drunk too
       canaries; and that's a marvellous searching wine, and it 1260
       the blood ere one can say 'What's this?' How do you now?

     * Doll Tearsheet. Better than I was—hem.

     * Hostess Quickly. Why, that's well said; a good heart's worth gold.
       Lo, here comes Sir John.

   Enter FALSTAFF
     * Falstaff. [Singing] 'When Arthur first in court'—Empty the
       Jordan. [Exit FRANCIS]—[Singing] 'And was a worthy king'—
       now, Mistress Doll!

     * Hostess Quickly. Sick of a calm; yea, good faith. 1275

     * Falstaff. So is all her sect; and they be once in a calm, they
       sick.

     * Doll Tearsheet. A pox damn you, you muddy rascal! Is that all the
       comfort
       give me? 1280

     * Falstaff. You make fat rascals, Mistress Doll.

     * Doll Tearsheet. I make them! Gluttony and diseases make them: I
       make them
       not.

     * Falstaff. If the cook help to make the gluttony, you help to 1285
       the diseases, Doll. We catch of you, Doll, we catch of you;
       that, my poor virtue, grant that.

     * Doll Tearsheet. Yea, joy, our chains and our jewels. 1290

     * Falstaff. 'Your brooches, pearls, and ouches.' For to serve
       is to come halting off; you know, to come off the breach with
       pike bent bravely, and to surgery bravely; to venture upon
       charg'd chambers bravely—

     * Doll Tearsheet. Hang yourself, you muddy conger, hang yourself!

     * Hostess Quickly. By my troth, this is the old fashion; you two
       never
       but you fall to some discord. You are both, i' good truth, as 1300
       rheumatic as two dry toasts; you cannot one bear with
       confirmities. What the good-year! one must bear, and that
       you. You are the weaker vessel, as as they say, the emptier
       vessel.

     * Doll Tearsheet. Can a weak empty vessel bear such a huge full
       hogs-head?
       There's a whole merchant's venture of Bourdeaux stuff in him;
       have not seen a hulk better stuff'd in the hold. Come, I'll 1310
       friends with thee, Jack. Thou art going to the wars; and
       I shall ever see thee again or no, there is nobody cares.

   Re-enter FRANCIS
     * Francis. Sir, Ancient Pistol's below and would speak with you.

     * Doll Tearsheet. Hang him, swaggering rascal! Let him not come
       hither; it
       the foul-mouth'dst rogue in England.

     * Hostess Quickly. If he swagger, let him not come here. No, by my
       faith!
       must live among my neighbours; I'll no swaggerers. I am in
       name and fame with the very best. Shut the door. There comes
       swaggerers here; I have not liv'd all this while to have
       swaggering now. Shut the door, I pray you. 1325

     * Falstaff. Dost thou hear, hostess?

     * Hostess Quickly. Pray ye, pacify yourself, Sir John; there comes no
       1330
       swaggerers here.

     * Falstaff. Dost thou hear? It is mine ancient.

     * Hostess Quickly. Tilly-fally, Sir John, ne'er tell me; and your
       ancient
       swagg'rer comes not in my doors. I was before Master Tisick,
       debuty, t' other day; and, as he said to me—'twas no longer 1335
       than Wednesday last, i' good faith!—'Neighbour Quickly,'
       he—Master Dumbe, our minister, was by then—'Neighbour
       says he 'receive those that are civil, for' said he 'you are
       an ill name.' Now 'a said so, I can tell whereupon. 'For'
       'you are an honest woman and well thought on, therefore take 1340
       what guests you receive. Receive' says he 'no swaggering
       companions.' There comes none here. You would bless you to
       what he said. No, I'll no swagg'rers.

     * Falstaff. He's no swagg'rer, hostess; a tame cheater, i' faith;
       may stroke him as gently as a puppy greyhound. He'll not
       with a Barbary hen, if her feathers turn back in any show of
       resistance. Call him up, drawer. 1355

   Exit FRANCIS
     * Hostess Quickly. Cheater, call you him? I will bar no honest man my
       nor no cheater; but I do not love swaggering, by my troth. I 1360
       the worse when one says 'swagger.' Feel, masters, how I
       look you, I warrant you.

     * Doll Tearsheet. So you do, hostess.

     * Hostess Quickly. Do I? Yea, in very truth, do I, an 'twere an aspen
       cannot abide swagg'rers.

   Enter PISTOL, BARDOLPH, and PAGE
     * Pistol. God save you, Sir John!

     * Falstaff. Welcome, Ancient Pistol. Here, Pistol, I charge you
       a cup of sack; do you discharge upon mine hostess.

     * Pistol. I will discharge upon her, Sir John, with two bullets. 1375

     * Falstaff. She is pistol-proof, sir; you shall not hardly offend
       her.

     * Hostess Quickly. Come, I'll drink no proofs nor no bullets. I'll
       drink
       more than will do me good, for no man's pleasure, I.

     * Pistol. Then to you, Mistress Dorothy; I will charge you.

     * Doll Tearsheet. Charge me! I scorn you, scurvy companion. What! you
       poor,
       base, rascally, cheating, lack-linen mate! Away, you mouldy
       rogue, away! I am meat for your master.

     * Pistol. I know you, Mistress Dorothy. 1385

     * Doll Tearsheet. Away, you cut-purse rascal! you filthy bung, away!
       By
       wine, I'll thrust my knife in your mouldy chaps, an you play
       saucy cuttle with me. Away, you bottle-ale rascal! you
       basket-hilt stale juggler, you! Since when, I pray you, sir?
       God's light, with two points on your shoulder? Much! 1390

     * Pistol. God let me not live but I will murder your ruff for

     * Falstaff. No more, Pistol; I would not have you go off here. 1395
       Discharge yourself of our company, Pistol.

     * Hostess Quickly. No, good Captain Pistol; not here, sweet captain.

     * Doll Tearsheet. Captain! Thou abominable damn'd cheater, art thou
       not
       to be called captain? An captains were of my mind, they would
       truncheon you out, for taking their names upon you before you 1400
       have earn'd them. You a captain! you slave, for what? For
       a poor whore's ruff in a bawdy-house? He a captain! hang him,
       rogue! He lives upon mouldy stew'd prunes and dried cakes. A
       captain! God's light, these villains will make the word as
       as the word 'occupy'; which was an excellent good word before 1405
       was ill sorted. Therefore captains had need look to't.

     * Bardolph. Pray thee go down, good ancient.

     * Falstaff. Hark thee hither, Mistress Doll.

     * Pistol. Not I! I tell thee what, Corporal Bardolph, I could
       her; I'll be reveng'd of her.

     * Page. Pray thee go down.

     * Pistol. I'll see her damn'd first; to Pluto's damn'd lake, by
       hand, to th' infernal deep, with Erebus and tortures vile
       Hold hook and line, say I. Down, down, dogs! down, faitors!
       we not Hiren here? 1420

     * Hostess Quickly. Good Captain Peesel, be quiet; 'tis very late, i'
       beseek you now, aggravate your choler. 1425

     * Pistol. These be good humours, indeed! Shall packhorses,
       And hollow pamper'd jades of Asia,
       Which cannot go but thirty mile a day,
       Compare with Caesars, and with Cannibals, 1430
       And Troiant Greeks? Nay, rather damn them with
       King Cerberus; and let the welkin roar.
       Shall we fall foul for toys?

     * Hostess Quickly. By my troth, Captain, these are very bitter words.

     * Bardolph. Be gone, good ancient; this will grow to a brawl 1435

     * Pistol. Die men like dogs! Give crowns like pins! Have we not
       here?

     * Hostess Quickly. O' my word, Captain, there's none such here. What
       the 1440
       good-year! do you think I would deny her? For God's sake, be
       quiet.

     * Pistol. Then feed and be fat, my fair Calipolis.
       Come, give's some sack.
       'Si fortune me tormente sperato me contento.' 1445
       Fear we broadsides? No, let the fiend give fire.
       Give me some sack; and, sweetheart, lie thou there.
       [Laying down his sword]
       Come we to full points here, and are etceteras nothings?

     * Falstaff. Pistol, I would be quiet. 1450

     * Pistol. Sweet knight, I kiss thy neaf. What! we have seen the
       stars.

     * Doll Tearsheet. For God's sake thrust him down stairs; I cannot
       endure
       fustian rascal. 1455

     * Pistol. Thrust him down stairs! Know we not Galloway nags?

     * Falstaff. Quoit him down, Bardolph, like a shove-groat
       Nay, an 'a do nothing but speak nothing, 'a shall be nothing
       here. 1460

     * Bardolph. Come, get you down stairs.

     * Pistol. What! shall we have incision? Shall we imbrue?
       [Snatching up his sword]
       Then death rock me asleep, abridge my doleful days! 1465
       Why, then, let grievous, ghastly, gaping wounds
       Untwine the Sisters Three! Come, Atropos, I say!

     * Hostess Quickly. Here's goodly stuff toward!

     * Falstaff. Give me my rapier, boy.

     * Doll Tearsheet. I pray thee, Jack, I pray thee, do not draw. 1470

     * Falstaff. Get you down stairs.

   [Drawing and driving PISTOL out]
     * Hostess Quickly. Here's a goodly tumult! I'll forswear keeping
       house
       I'll be in these tirrits and frights. So; murder, I warrant
       Alas, alas! put up your naked weapons, put up your naked 1475

   Exeunt PISTOL and BARDOLPH
     * Doll Tearsheet. I pray thee, Jack, be quiet; the rascal's gone. Ah,
       you 1480
       whoreson little valiant villain, you!

     * Hostess Quickly. Are you not hurt i' th' groin? Methought 'a made a
       thrust at your belly.

   Re-enter BARDOLPH
     * Falstaff. Have you turn'd him out a doors?

     * Bardolph. Yea, sir. The rascal's drunk. You have hurt him, sir,
       th' shoulder.

     * Falstaff. A rascal! to brave me! 1490

     * Doll Tearsheet. Ah, you sweet little rogue, you! Alas, poor ape,
       how thou
       sweat'st! Come, let me wipe thy face. Come on, you whoreson
       chops. Ah, rogue! i' faith, I love thee. Thou art as valorous
       Hector of Troy, worth five of Agamemnon, and ten times better
       than the Nine Worthies. Ah, villain! 1495

     * Falstaff. A rascally slave! I will toss the rogue in a blanket.

     * Doll Tearsheet. Do, an thou dar'st for thy heart. An thou dost,
       I'll
       thee between a pair of sheets.

   Enter musicians
     * Page. The music is come, sir.

     * Falstaff. Let them play. Play, sirs. Sit on my knee, Don. A
       bragging slave! The rogue fled from me like quick-silver.

     * Doll Tearsheet. I' faith, and thou follow'dst him like a church.
       Thou
       whoreson little tidy Bartholomew boar-pig, when wilt thou
       fighting a days and foining a nights, and begin to patch up
       old body for heaven?
       Enter, behind, PRINCE HENRY and POINS disguised as drawers 1510

     * Falstaff. Peace, good Doll! Do not speak like a death's-head;
       not bid me remember mine end.

     * Doll Tearsheet. Sirrah, what humour's the Prince of?

     * Falstaff. A good shallow young fellow. 'A would have made a
       pantler; 'a would ha' chipp'd bread well.

     * Doll Tearsheet. They say Poins has a good wit. 1520

     * Falstaff. He a good wit! hang him, baboon! His wit's as thick
       Tewksbury mustard; there's no more conceit in him than is in
       mallet.

     * Doll Tearsheet. Why does the Prince love him so, then?

     * Falstaff. Because their legs are both of a bigness, and 'a
       quoits well, and eats conger and fennel, and drinks off
       ends for flap-dragons, and rides the wild mare with the boys,
       jumps upon join'd-stools, and swears with a good grace, and 1530
       his boots very smooth, like unto the sign of the Leg, and
       no bate with telling of discreet stories; and such other
       faculties 'a has, that show a weak mind and an able body, for
       which the Prince admits him. For the Prince himself is such
       another; the weight of a hair will turn the scales between 1535
       avoirdupois.

     * Henry V. Would not this nave of a wheel have his ears cut off? 1545

     * Edward Poins. Let's beat him before his whore.

     * Henry V. Look whe'er the wither'd elder hath not his poll claw'd
       like a parrot.

     * Edward Poins. Is it not strange that desire should so many years
       performance? 1550

     * Falstaff. Kiss me, Doll.

     * Henry V. Saturn and Venus this year in conjunction! What says
       almanac to that?

     * Edward Poins. And look whether the fiery Trigon, his man, be not
       to his master's old tables, his note-book, his

     * Falstaff. Thou dost give me flattering busses. 1560

     * Doll Tearsheet. By my troth, I kiss thee with a most constant
       heart.

     * Falstaff. I am old, I am old.

     * Doll Tearsheet. I love thee better than I love e'er a scurvy young
       boy of
       them all.

     * Falstaff. What stuff wilt have a kirtle of? I shall receive 1565
       Thursday. Shalt have a cap to-morrow. A merry song, come. 'A
       grows late; we'll to bed. Thou't forget me when I am gone.

     * Doll Tearsheet. By my troth, thou't set me a-weeping, an thou
       say'st so.
       Prove that ever I dress myself handsome till thy return. 1570
       hearken a' th' end.

     * Falstaff. Some sack, Francis.

     * Henry V. [with POINS:] Anon, anon, sir. [Advancing]

     * Falstaff. Ha! a bastard son of the King's? And art thou not 1575
       his brother?

     * Henry V. Why, thou globe of sinful continents, what a life dost
       lead!

     * Falstaff. A better than thou. I am a gentleman: thou art a

     * Henry V. Very true, sir, and I come to draw you out by the ears.

     * Hostess Quickly. O, the Lord preserve thy Grace! By my troth,
       welcome
       London. Now the Lord bless that sweet face of thine. O Jesu, are
       you come from Wales? 1585

     * Falstaff. Thou whoreson mad compound of majesty, by this light
       flesh and corrupt blood, thou art welcome.

   [Leaning his band upon DOLL]
     * Doll Tearsheet. How, you fat fool! I scorn you. 1590

     * Edward Poins. My lord, he will drive you out of your revenge and
       turn
       to a merriment, if you take not the heat.

     * Henry V. YOU whoreson candle-mine, you, how vilely did you speak
       me even now before this honest, virtuous, civil gentlewoman! 1595

     * Hostess Quickly. God's blessing of your good heart! and so she is,
       by
       troth.

     * Falstaff. Didst thou hear me? 1600

     * Henry V. Yea; and you knew me, as you did when you ran away by
       Gadshill. You knew I was at your back, and spoke it on
       try my patience.

     * Falstaff. No, no, no; not so; I did not think thou wast within 1605
       hearing.

     * Henry V. I shall drive you then to confess the wilful abuse, and
       then I know how to handle you.

     * Falstaff. No abuse, Hal, o' mine honour; no abuse.

     * Henry V. Not to dispraise me, and call me pander, and 1610
       bread-chipper, and I know not what!

     * Falstaff. No abuse, Hal.

     * Edward Poins. No abuse!

     * Falstaff. No abuse, Ned, i' th' world; honest Ned, none. I
       disprais'd him before the wicked—that the wicked might not 1615
       in love with thee; in which doing, I have done the part of a
       careful friend and a true subject; and thy father is to give
       thanks for it. No abuse, Hal; none, Ned, none; no, faith,
       none.

     * Henry V. See now, whether pure fear and entire cowardice doth
       make thee wrong this virtuous gentlewoman to close with us?
       she of the wicked? Is thine hostess here of the wicked? Or is 1625
       boy of the wicked? Or honest Bardolph, whose zeal burns in
       nose, of the wicked?

     * Edward Poins. Answer, thou dead elm, answer.

     * Falstaff. The fiend hath prick'd down Bardolph irrecoverable;
       his face is Lucifer's privy-kitchen, where he doth nothing
       roast malt-worms. For the boy—there is a good angel about 1635
       but the devil outbids him too.

     * Henry V. For the women? 1640

     * Falstaff. For one of them—she's in hell already, and burns
       souls. For th' other—I owe her money; and whether she be
       for that, I know not.

     * Hostess Quickly. No, I warrant you.

     * Falstaff. No, I think thou art not; I think thou art quit for
       Marry, there is another indictment upon thee for suffering
       to be eaten in thy house, contrary to the law; for the which
       think thou wilt howl. 1650

     * Hostess Quickly. All vict'lers do so. What's a joint of mutton or
       two
       whole Lent? 1655

     * Henry V. You, gentlewoman—

     * Doll Tearsheet. What says your Grace?

     * Falstaff. His Grace says that which his flesh rebels against.

   [Knocking within]
     * Hostess Quickly. Who knocks so loud at door? Look to th' door
       there,
       Francis.

   Enter PETO
     * Henry V. Peto, how now! What news?

     * Peto. The King your father is at Westminster; 1665
       And there are twenty weak and wearied posts
       Come from the north; and as I came along
       I met and overtook a dozen captains,
       Bare-headed, sweating, knocking at the taverns,
       And asking every one for Sir John Falstaff. 1670

     * Henry V. By heaven, Poins, I feel me much to blame
       So idly to profane the precious time,
       When tempest of commotion, like the south,
       Borne with black vapour, doth begin to melt
       And drop upon our bare unarmed heads. 1675
       Give me my sword and cloak. Falstaff, good night.

   Exeunt PRINCE, POINS, PETO, and BARDOLPH
     * Falstaff. Now comes in the sweetest morsel of the night, and we
       must hence, and leave it unpick'd. [Knocking within] More
       knocking at the door! 1680
       [Re-enter BARDOLPH]
       How now! What's the matter?

     * Bardolph. You must away to court, sir, presently;
       A dozen captains stay at door for you.

     * Falstaff. [To the PAGE]. Pay the musicians, sirrah.—Farewell, 1685
       hostess; farewell, Doll. You see, my good wenches, how men of
       merit are sought after; the undeserver may sleep, when the
       action is call'd on. Farewell, good wenches. If I be not sent
       away post, I will see you again ere I go.

     * Doll Tearsheet. I cannot speak. If my heart be not ready to burst!
       Well, sweet Jack, have a care of thyself.

     * Falstaff. Farewell, farewell.

   Exeunt FALSTAFF and BARDOLPH
     * Hostess Quickly. Well, fare thee well. I have known thee these 1695
       years, come peascod-time; but an honester and truer-hearted

     * Bardolph. [Within] Mistress Tearsheet!

     * Hostess Quickly. What's the matter? 1700

     * Bardolph. [Within] Bid Mistress Tearsheet come to my master.

     * Hostess Quickly. O, run Doll, run, run, good Come. [To BARDOLPH]
       She
       comes blubber'd.—Yea, will you come, Doll? Exeunt

   Act III, Scene 1

   Westminster. The palace
   _______________________________________________________________________

   Enter the KING in his nightgown, with a page
     * Henry IV. Go call the Earls of Surrey and of Warwick; 1705
       But, ere they come, bid them o'er-read these letters
       And well consider of them. Make good speed. Exit page
       How many thousands of my poorest subjects
       Are at this hour asleep! O sleep, O gentle sleep,
       Nature's soft nurse, how have I frightened thee, 1710
       That thou no more will weigh my eyelids down,
       And steep my senses in forgetfulness?
       Why rather, sleep, liest thou in smoky cribs,
       Upon uneasy pallets stretching thee,
       And hush'd with buzzing night-flies to thy slumber, 1715
       Than in the perfum'd chambers of the great,
       Under the canopies of costly state,
       And lull'd with sound of sweetest melody?
       O thou dull god, why liest thou with the vile
       In loathsome beds, and leav'st the kingly couch 1720
       A watch-case or a common 'larum-bell?
       Wilt thou upon the high and giddy mast
       Seal up the ship-boy's eyes, and rock his brains
       In cradle of the rude imperious surge,
       And in the visitation of the winds, 1725
       Who take the ruffian billows by the top,
       Curling their monstrous heads, and hanging them
       With deafing clamour in the slippery clouds,
       That with the hurly death itself awakes?
       Canst thou, O partial sleep, give thy repose 1730
       To the wet sea-boy in an hour so rude;
       And in the calmest and most stillest night,
       With all appliances and means to boot,
       Deny it to a king? Then, happy low, lie down!
       Uneasy lies the head that wears a crown. 1735

   Enter WARWICK and Surrey
     * Earl of Warwick. Many good morrows to your Majesty!

     * Henry IV. Is it good morrow, lords?

     * Earl of Warwick. 'Tis one o'clock, and past.

     * Henry IV. Why then, good morrow to you all, my lords. 1740
       Have you read o'er the letters that I sent you?

     * Earl of Warwick. We have, my liege.

     * Henry IV. Then you perceive the body of our kingdom
       How foul it is; what rank diseases grow,
       And with what danger, near the heart of it. 1745

     * Earl of Warwick. It is but as a body yet distempered;
       Which to his former strength may be restored
       With good advice and little medicine.
       My Lord Northumberland will soon be cool'd.

     * Henry IV. O God! that one might read the book of fate, 1750
       And see the revolution of the times
       Make mountains level, and the continent,
       Weary of solid firmness, melt itself
       Into the sea; and other times to see
       The beachy girdle of the ocean 1755
       Too wide for Neptune's hips; how chances mock,
       And changes fill the cup of alteration
       With divers liquors! O, if this were seen,
       The happiest youth, viewing his progress through,
       What perils past, what crosses to ensue, 1760
       Would shut the book and sit him down and die.
       'Tis not ten years gone
       Since Richard and Northumberland, great friends,
       Did feast together, and in two years after
       Were they at wars. It is but eight years since 1765
       This Percy was the man nearest my soul;
       Who like a brother toil'd in my affairs
       And laid his love and life under my foot;
       Yea, for my sake, even to the eyes of Richard
       Gave him defiance. But which of you was by— 1770
       [To WARWICK] You, cousin Nevil, as I may remember—
       When Richard, with his eye brim full of tears,
       Then check'd and rated by Northumberland,
       Did speak these words, now prov'd a prophecy?
       'Northumberland, thou ladder by the which 1775
       My cousin Bolingbroke ascends my throne'—
       Though then, God knows, I had no such intent
       But that necessity so bow'd the state
       That I and greatness were compell'd to kiss—
       'The time shall come'—thus did he follow it— 1780
       'The time will come that foul sin, gathering head,
       Shall break into corruption' so went on,
       Foretelling this same time's condition
       And the division of our amity.

     * Earl of Warwick. There is a history in all men's lives, 1785
       Figuring the natures of the times deceas'd;
       The which observ'd, a man may prophesy,
       With a near aim, of the main chance of things
       As yet not come to life, who in their seeds
       And weak beginning lie intreasured. 1790
       Such things become the hatch and brood of time;
       And, by the necessary form of this,
       King Richard might create a perfect guess
       That great Northumberland, then false to him,
       Would of that seed grow to a greater falseness; 1795
       Which should not find a ground to root upon
       Unless on you.

     * Henry IV. Are these things then necessities?
       Then let us meet them like necessities;
       And that same word even now cries out on us. 1800
       They say the Bishop and Northumberland
       Are fifty thousand strong.

     * Earl of Warwick. It cannot be, my lord.
       Rumour doth double, like the voice and echo,
       The numbers of the feared. Please it your Grace 1805
       To go to bed. Upon my soul, my lord,
       The powers that you already have sent forth
       Shall bring this prize in very easily.
       To comfort you the more, I have receiv'd
       A certain instance that Glendower is dead. 1810
       Your Majesty hath been this fortnight ill;
       And these unseasoned hours perforce must ad
       Unto your sickness.

     * Henry IV. I will take your counsel.
       And, were these inward wars once out of hand, 1815
       We would, dear lords, unto the Holy Land. Exeunt

   Act III, Scene 2

   Gloucestershire. Before Justice, SHALLOW’S house
   _______________________________________________________________________

   Enter SHALLOW and SILENCE, meeting; MOULDY, SHADOW, WART, FEEBLE,
   BULLCALF, and servants behind
     * Robert Shallow. Come on, come on, come on; give me your hand, sir;
       your hand, sir. An early stirrer, by the rood! And how doth
       good cousin Silence? 1820

     * Silence. Good morrow, good cousin Shallow.

     * Robert Shallow. And how doth my cousin, your bed-fellow? and your
       daughter and mine, my god-daughter Ellen? 1825

     * Silence. Alas, a black ousel, cousin Shallow!

     * Robert Shallow. By yea and no, sir. I dare say my cousin William is
       a good scholar; he is at Oxford still, is he not?

     * Silence. Indeed, sir, to my cost.

     * Robert Shallow. 'A must, then, to the Inns o' Court shortly. I was
       Clement's Inn; where I think they will talk of mad Shallow

     * Silence. You were call'd 'lusty Shallow' then, cousin.

     * Robert Shallow. By the mass, I was call'd anything; and I would
       have
       anything indeed too, and roundly too. There was I, and little
       John Doit of Staffordshire, and black George Barnes, and
       Pickbone, and Will Squele a Cotsole man—you had not four 1840
       swinge-bucklers in all the Inns of Court again. And I may say
       you we knew where the bona-robas were, and had the best of
       all at commandment. Then was Jack Falstaff, now Sir John,
       and page to Thomas Mowbray, Duke of Norfolk.

     * Silence. This Sir John, cousin, that comes hither anon about
       soldiers?

     * Robert Shallow. The same Sir John, the very same. I see him break
       Scoggin's head at the court gate, when 'a was a crack not
       high; and the very same day did I fight with one Sampson 1855
       Stockfish, a fruiterer, behind Gray's Inn. Jesu, Jesu, the
       days that I have spent! and to see how many of my old
       acquaintance are dead!

     * Silence. We shall all follow, cousin.

     * Robert Shallow. Certain, 'tis certain; very sure, very sure. Death,
       as
       Psalmist saith, is certain to all; all shall die. How a good
       of bullocks at Stamford fair?

     * Silence. By my troth, I was not there.

     * Robert Shallow. Death is certain. Is old Double of your town living

     * Silence. Dead, sir. 1870

     * Robert Shallow. Jesu, Jesu, dead! drew a good bow; and dead! 'A
       shot a
       fine shoot. John a Gaunt loved him well, and betted much
       his head. Dead! 'A would have clapp'd i' th' clout at twelve
       score, and carried you a forehand shaft a fourteen and
       and a half, that it would have done a man's heart good to 1875
       How a score of ewes now?

     * Silence. Thereafter as they be—a score of good ewes may be 1880
       ten pounds.

     * Robert Shallow. And is old Double dead?

   Enter BARDOLPH, and one with him
     * Silence. Here come two of Sir John Falstaffs men, as I think. 1885

     * Robert Shallow. Good morrow, honest gentlemen.

     * Bardolph. I beseech you, which is Justice Shallow?

     * Robert Shallow. I am Robert Shallow, sir, a poor esquire of this
       and one of the King's justices of the peace. What is your
       pleasure with me? 1890

     * Bardolph. My captain, sir, commends him to you; my captain, Sir
       John Falstaff—a tall gentleman, by heaven, and a most
       leader. 1895

     * Robert Shallow. He greets me well, sir; I knew him a good
       back-sword
       How doth the good knight? May I ask how my lady his wife

     * Bardolph. Sir, pardon; a soldier is better accommodated than
       wife.

     * Robert Shallow. It is well said, in faith, sir; and it is well said
       too. 'Better accommodated!' It is good; yea, indeed, is it. 1905
       phrases are surely, and ever were, very commendable.
       'Accommodated!' It comes of accommodo. Very good; a good

     * Bardolph. Pardon, sir; I have heard the word. 'Phrase' call you
       By this day, I know not the phrase; but I will maintain the
       with my sword to be a soldier-like word, and a word of
       good command, by heaven. Accommodated: that is, when a man
       they say, accommodated; or, when a man is being-whereby 'a 1915
       thought to be accommodated; which is an excellent thing.

   Enter FALSTAFF
     * Robert Shallow. It is very just. Look, here comes good Sir John.
       Give
       your good hand, give me your worship's good hand. By my
       you like well and bear your years very well. Welcome, good 1925
       John.

     * Falstaff. I am glad to see you well, good Master Robert 1930
       Master Surecard, as I think?

     * Robert Shallow. No, Sir John; it is my cousin Silence, in
       commission with me.

     * Falstaff. Good Master Silence, it well befits you should be of
       peace. 1935

     * Silence. Your good worship is welcome.

     * Falstaff. Fie! this is hot weather. Gentlemen, have you
       here half a dozen sufficient men?

     * Robert Shallow. Marry, have we, sir. Will you sit?

     * Falstaff. Let me see them, I beseech you.

     * Robert Shallow. Where's the roll? Where's the roll? Where's the
       roll?
       me see, let me see, let me see. So, so, so, so,—so, so—yea,
       marry, sir. Rafe Mouldy! Let them appear as I call; let them 1945
       so, let them do so. Let me see; where is Mouldy?

     * Ralph Mouldy. Here, an't please you.

     * Robert Shallow. What think you, Sir John? A good-limb'd fellow;
       young, 1950
       strong, and of good friends.

     * Falstaff. Is thy name Mouldy?

     * Ralph Mouldy. Yea, an't please you.

     * Falstaff. 'Tis the more time thou wert us'd.

     * Robert Shallow. Ha, ha, ha! most excellent, i' faith! Things that
       are 1955
       mouldy lack use. Very singular good! In faith, well said, Sir
       John; very well said.

     * Falstaff. Prick him.

     * Ralph Mouldy. I was prick'd well enough before, an you could have
       let
       alone. My old dame will be undone now for one to do her 1960
       and her drudgery. You need not to have prick'd me; there are
       other men fitter to go out than I.

     * Falstaff. Go to; peace, Mouldy; you shall go. Mouldy, it is 1965
       you were spent.

     * Ralph Mouldy. Spent!

     * Robert Shallow. Peace, fellow, peace; stand aside; know you where
       you
       For th' other, Sir John—let me see. Simon Shadow! 1970

     * Falstaff. Yea, marry, let me have him to sit under. He's like
       a cold soldier.

     * Robert Shallow. Where's Shadow? 1975

     * Simon Shadow. Here, sir.

     * Falstaff. Shadow, whose son art thou?

     * Simon Shadow. My mother's son, sir.

     * Falstaff. Thy mother's son! Like enough; and thy father's
       So the son of the female is the shadow of the male. It is 1980
       so indeed; but much of the father's substance!

     * Robert Shallow. Do you like him, Sir John?

     * Falstaff. Shadow will serve for summer. Prick him; for we have 1985
       number of shadows fill up the muster-book.

     * Robert Shallow. Thomas Wart!

     * Falstaff. Where's he?

     * Thomas Wart. Here, sir. 1990

     * Falstaff. Is thy name Wart?

     * Thomas Wart. Yea, sir.

     * Falstaff. Thou art a very ragged wart.

     * Robert Shallow. Shall I prick him, Sir John?

     * Falstaff. It were superfluous; for his apparel is built upon 1995
       back, and the whole frame stands upon pins. Prick him no

     * Robert Shallow. Ha, ha, ha! You can do it, sir; you can do it. I
       you well. Francis Feeble! 2000

     * Francis Feeble. Here, sir.

     * Falstaff. What trade art thou, Feeble?

     * Francis Feeble. A woman's tailor, sir.

     * Robert Shallow. Shall I prick him, sir? 2005

     * Falstaff. You may; but if he had been a man's tailor, he'd ha'
       prick'd you. Wilt thou make as many holes in an enemy's
       thou hast done in a woman's petticoat?

     * Francis Feeble. I will do my good will, sir; you can have no more.
       2010

     * Falstaff. Well said, good woman's tailor! well said, courageous
       Feeble! Thou wilt be as valiant as the wrathful dove or most
       magnanimous mouse. Prick the woman's tailor—well, Master
       Shallow, deep, Master Shallow.

     * Francis Feeble. I would Wart might have gone, sir. 2015

     * Falstaff. I would thou wert a man's tailor, that thou mightst
       him and make him fit to go. I cannot put him to a private
       soldier, that is the leader of so many thousands. Let that
       suffice, most forcible Feeble.

     * Francis Feeble. It shall suffice, sir.

     * Falstaff. I am bound to thee, reverend Feeble. Who is next?

     * Robert Shallow. Peter Bullcalf o' th' green!

     * Falstaff. Yea, marry, let's see Bullcalf.

     * Peter Bullcalf. Here, sir. 2025

     * Falstaff. Fore God, a likely fellow! Come, prick me Bullcalf
       he roar again.

     * Peter Bullcalf. O Lord! good my lord captain-

     * Falstaff. What, dost thou roar before thou art prick'd? 2030

     * Peter Bullcalf. O Lord, sir! I am a diseased man.

     * Falstaff. What disease hast thou?

     * Peter Bullcalf. A whoreson cold, sir, a cough, sir, which I caught
       ringing in the King's affairs upon his coronation day, sir.

     * Falstaff. Come, thou shalt go to the wars in a gown. We will
       away thy cold; and I will take such order that thy friends
       ring for thee. Is here all?

     * Robert Shallow. Here is two more call'd than your number. You must
       but four here, sir; and so, I pray you, go in with me to

     * Falstaff. Come, I will go drink with you, but I cannot tarry 2045
       dinner. I am glad to see you, by my troth, Master Shallow.

     * Robert Shallow. O, Sir John, do you remember since we lay all night
       in
       windmill in Saint George's Field?

     * Falstaff. No more of that, Master Shallow, no more of that. 2050

     * Robert Shallow. Ha, 'twas a merry night. And is Jane Nightwork
       alive?

     * Falstaff. She lives, Master Shallow.

     * Robert Shallow. She never could away with me.

     * Falstaff. Never, never; she would always say she could not
       Master Shallow. 2055

     * Robert Shallow. By the mass, I could anger her to th' heart. She
       was
       a bona-roba. Doth she hold her own well?

     * Falstaff. Old, old, Master Shallow. 2060

     * Robert Shallow. Nay, she must be old; she cannot choose but be old;
       certain she's old; and had Robin Nightwork, by old Nightwork,
       before I came to Clement's Inn.

     * Silence. That's fifty-five year ago.

     * Robert Shallow. Ha, cousin Silence, that thou hadst seen that that
       2065
       knight and I have seen! Ha, Sir John, said I well?

     * Falstaff. We have heard the chimes at midnight, Master Shallow.

     * Robert Shallow. That we have, that we have, that we have; in faith,
       John, we have. Our watchword was 'Hem, boys!' Come, let's to 2070
       dinner; come, let's to dinner. Jesus, the days that we have
       Come, come.

   Exeunt FALSTAFF and the JUSTICES
     * Peter Bullcalf. Good Master Corporate Bardolph, stand my friend;
       and
       here's four Harry ten shillings in French crowns for you. In
       truth, sir, I had as lief be hang'd, sir, as go. And yet, for
       mine own part, sir, I do not care; but rather because I am
       unwilling and, for mine own part, have a desire to stay with 2080
       friends; else, sir, I did not care for mine own part so much.

     * Bardolph. Go to; stand aside.

     * Ralph Mouldy. And, good Master Corporal Captain, for my old dame's
       2085
       stand my friend. She has nobody to do anything about her when
       am gone; and she is old, and cannot help herself. You shall
       forty, sir.

     * Bardolph. Go to; stand aside.

     * Francis Feeble. By my troth, I care not; a man can die but once; we
       owe
       a death. I'll ne'er bear a base mind. An't be my destiny, so;
       an't be not, so. No man's too good to serve 's Prince; and, 2095
       it go which way it will, he that dies this year is quit for
       next.

     * Bardolph. Well said; th'art a good fellow.

     * Francis Feeble. Faith, I'll bear no base mind.

   Re-enter FALSTAFF and the JUSTICES
     * Falstaff. Come, sir, which men shall I have?

     * Robert Shallow. Four of which you please. 2105

     * Bardolph. Sir, a word with you. I have three pound to free
       and Bullcalf.

     * Falstaff. Go to; well.

     * Robert Shallow. Come, Sir John, which four will you have? 2110

     * Falstaff. Do you choose for me.

     * Robert Shallow. Marry, then—Mouldy, Bullcalf, Feeble, and Shadow.

     * Falstaff. Mouldy and Bullcalf: for you, Mouldy, stay at home
       you are past service; and for your part, Bullcalf, grow you
       unto it. I will none of you. 2115

     * Robert Shallow. Sir John, Sir John, do not yourself wrong. They are
       likeliest men, and I would have you serv'd with the best.

     * Falstaff. Will you tell me, Master Shallow, how to choose a
       Care I for the limb, the thews, the stature, bulk, and big
       assemblance of a man! Give me the spirit, Master Shallow.
       Wart; you see what a ragged appearance it is. 'A shall charge
       and discharge you with the motion of a pewterer's hammer, 2125
       off and on swifter than he that gibbets on the brewer's
       And this same half-fac'd fellow, Shadow—give me this man. He
       presents no mark to the enemy; the foeman may with as great
       level at the edge of a penknife. And, for a retreat—how
       will this Feeble, the woman's tailor, run off! O, give me the 2130
       spare men, and spare me the great ones. Put me a caliver into
       Wart's hand, Bardolph.

     * Bardolph. Hold, Wart. Traverse—thus, thus, thus. 2140

     * Falstaff. Come, manage me your caliver. So—very well. Go to;
       good; exceeding good. O, give me always a little, lean, old,
       chopt, bald shot. Well said, i' faith, Wart; th'art a good
       Hold, there's a tester for thee.

     * Robert Shallow. He is not his craft's master, he doth not do it
       right.
       remember at Mile-end Green, when I lay at Clement's Inn—I
       then Sir Dagonet in Arthur's show—there was a little quiver
       fellow, and 'a would manage you his piece thus; and 'a would 2150
       about and about, and come you in and come you in. 'Rah, tah,
       tah!' would 'a say; 'Bounce!' would 'a say; and away again
       'a go, and again would 'a come. I shall ne'er see such a

     * Falstaff. These fellows will do well. Master Shallow, God keep
       Master Silence, I will not use many words with you: Fare you
       well! Gentlemen both, I thank you. I must a dozen mile 2160
       Bardolph, give the soldiers coats.

     * Robert Shallow. Sir John, the Lord bless you; God prosper your
       God send us peace! At your return, visit our house; let our 2165
       acquaintance be renewed. Peradventure I will with ye to the
       court.

     * Falstaff. Fore God, would you would. 2170

     * Robert Shallow. Go to; I have spoke at a word. God keep you.

     * Falstaff. Fare you well, gentle gentlemen. [Exeunt JUSTICES] On,
       Bardolph; lead the men away. [Exeunt all but FALSTAFF] As I
       return, I will fetch off these justices. I do see the bottom of
       justice Shallow. Lord, Lord, how subject we old men are to this
       2175
       vice of lying! This same starv'd justice hath done nothing but
       prate to me of the wildness of his youth and the feats he hath
       done about Turnbull Street; and every third word a lie, duer paid
       to the hearer than the Turk's tribute. I do remember him at
       Clement's Inn, like a man made after supper of a cheese-paring.
       2180
       When 'a was naked, he was for all the world like a fork'd radish,
       with a head fantastically carved upon it with a knife. 'A was so
       forlorn that his dimensions to any thick sight were invisible. 'A
       was the very genius of famine; yet lecherous as a monkey, and the
       whores call'd him mandrake. 'A came ever in the rearward of the
       2185
       fashion, and sung those tunes to the overscutch'd huswifes that
       he heard the carmen whistle, and sware they were his fancies or
       his good-nights. And now is this Vice's dagger become a squire,
       and talks as familiarly of John a Gaunt as if he had been sworn
       brother to him; and I'll be sworn 'a ne'er saw him but once in 2190
       the Tiltyard; and then he burst his head for crowding among the
       marshal's men. I saw it, and told John a Gaunt he beat his own
       name; for you might have thrust him and all his apparel into an
       eel-skin; the case of a treble hautboy was a mansion for him, a
       court—and now has he land and beeves. Well, I'll be acquainted 2195
       with him if I return; and 't shall go hard but I'll make him a
       philosopher's two stones to me. If the young dace be a bait for
       the old pike, I see no reason in the law of nature but I may snap
       at him. Let time shape, and there an end. Exit

   Act IV, Scene 1

   Yorkshire. Within the Forest of Gaultree
   _______________________________________________________________________

   Enter the ARCHBISHOP OF YORK, MOWBRAY, HASTINGS, and others
     * Archbishop Scroop. What is this forest call'd

     * Lord Hastings. 'Tis Gaultree Forest, an't shall please your Grace.

     * Archbishop Scroop. Here stand, my lords, and send discoverers forth
       To know the numbers of our enemies.

     * Lord Hastings. We have sent forth already. 2205

     * Archbishop Scroop. 'Tis well done.
       My friends and brethren in these great affairs,
       I must acquaint you that I have receiv'd
       New-dated letters from Northumberland;
       Their cold intent, tenour, and substance, thus: 2210
       Here doth he wish his person, with such powers
       As might hold sortance with his quality,
       The which he could not levy; whereupon
       He is retir'd, to ripe his growing fortunes,
       To Scotland; and concludes in hearty prayers 2215
       That your attempts may overlive the hazard
       And fearful meeting of their opposite.

     * Lord Mowbray. Thus do the hopes we have in him touch ground
       And dash themselves to pieces.

   Enter A MESSENGER
     * Lord Hastings. Now, what news?

     * Messenger. West of this forest, scarcely off a mile,
       In goodly form comes on the enemy;
       And, by the ground they hide, I judge their number
       Upon or near the rate of thirty thousand. 2225

     * Lord Mowbray. The just proportion that we gave them out.
       Let us sway on and face them in the field.

   Enter WESTMORELAND
     * Archbishop Scroop. What well-appointed leader fronts us here?

     * Lord Mowbray. I think it is my Lord of Westmoreland. 2230

     * Earl of Westmoreland. Health and fair greeting from our general,
       The Prince, Lord John and Duke of Lancaster.

     * Archbishop Scroop. Say on, my Lord of Westmoreland, in peace,
       What doth concern your coming.

     * Earl of Westmoreland. Then, my lord, 2235
       Unto your Grace do I in chief address
       The substance of my speech. If that rebellion
       Came like itself, in base and abject routs,
       Led on by bloody youth, guarded with rags,
       And countenanc'd by boys and beggary- 2240
       I say, if damn'd commotion so appear'd
       In his true, native, and most proper shape,
       You, reverend father, and these noble lords,
       Had not been here to dress the ugly form
       Of base and bloody insurrection 2245
       With your fair honours. You, Lord Archbishop,
       Whose see is by a civil peace maintain'd,
       Whose beard the silver hand of peace hath touch'd,
       Whose learning and good letters peace hath tutor'd,
       Whose white investments figure innocence, 2250
       The dove, and very blessed spirit of peace-
       Wherefore you do so ill translate yourself
       Out of the speech of peace, that bears such grace,
       Into the harsh and boist'rous tongue of war;
       Turning your books to graves, your ink to blood, 2255
       Your pens to lances, and your tongue divine
       To a loud trumpet and a point of war?

     * Archbishop Scroop. Wherefore do I this? So the question stands.
       Briefly to this end: we are all diseas'd
       And with our surfeiting and wanton hours 2260
       Have brought ourselves into a burning fever,
       And we must bleed for it; of which disease
       Our late King, Richard, being infected, died.
       But, my most noble Lord of Westmoreland,
       I take not on me here as a physician; 2265
       Nor do I as an enemy to peace
       Troop in the throngs of military men;
       But rather show awhile like fearful war
       To diet rank minds sick of happiness,
       And purge th' obstructions which begin to stop 2270
       Our very veins of life. Hear me more plainly.
       I have in equal balance justly weigh'd
       What wrongs our arms may do, what wrongs we suffer,
       And find our griefs heavier than our offences.
       We see which way the stream of time doth run 2275
       And are enforc'd from our most quiet there
       By the rough torrent of occasion;
       And have the summary of all our griefs,
       When time shall serve, to show in articles;
       Which long ere this we offer'd to the King, 2280
       And might by no suit gain our audience:
       When we are wrong'd, and would unfold our griefs,
       We are denied access unto his person,
       Even by those men that most have done us wrong.
       The dangers of the days but newly gone, 2285
       Whose memory is written on the earth
       With yet appearing blood, and the examples
       Of every minute's instance, present now,
       Hath put us in these ill-beseeming arms;
       Not to break peace, or any branch of it, 2290
       But to establish here a peace indeed,
       Concurring both in name and quality.

     * Earl of Westmoreland. When ever yet was your appeal denied;
       Wherein have you been galled by the King;
       What peer hath been suborn'd to grate on you 2295
       That you should seal this lawless bloody book
       Of forg'd rebellion with a seal divine,
       And consecrate commotion's bitter edge?

     * Archbishop Scroop. My brother general, the commonwealth,
       To brother horn an household cruelty, 2300
       I make my quarrel in particular.

     * Earl of Westmoreland. There is no need of any such redress;
       Or if there were, it not belongs to you.

     * Lord Mowbray. Why not to him in part, and to us all
       That feel the bruises of the days before, 2305
       And suffer the condition of these times
       To lay a heavy and unequal hand
       Upon our honours?

     * Earl of Westmoreland. O my good Lord Mowbray,
       Construe the times to their necessities, 2310
       And you shall say, indeed, it is the time,
       And not the King, that doth you injuries.
       Yet, for your part, it not appears to me,
       Either from the King or in the present time,
       That you should have an inch of any ground 2315
       To build a grief on. Were you not restor'd
       To all the Duke of Norfolk's signiories,
       Your noble and right well-rememb'red father's?

     * Lord Mowbray. What thing, in honour, had my father lost
       That need to be reviv'd and breath'd in me? 2320
       The King that lov'd him, as the state stood then,
       Was force perforce compell'd to banish him,
       And then that Henry Bolingbroke and he,
       Being mounted and both roused in their seats,
       Their neighing coursers daring of the spur, 2325
       Their armed staves in charge, their beavers down,
       Their eyes of fire sparkling through sights of steel,
       And the loud trumpet blowing them together—
       Then, then, when there was nothing could have stay'd
       My father from the breast of Bolingbroke, 2330
       O, when the King did throw his warder down—
       His own life hung upon the staff he threw—
       Then threw he down himself, and all their lives
       That by indictment and by dint of sword
       Have since miscarried under Bolingbroke. 2335

     * Earl of Westmoreland. You speak, Lord Mowbray, now you know not
       what.
       The Earl of Hereford was reputed then
       In England the most valiant gentleman.
       Who knows on whom fortune would then have smil'd?
       But if your father had been victor there, 2340
       He ne'er had borne it out of Coventry;
       For all the country, in a general voice,
       Cried hate upon him; and all their prayers and love
       Were set on Hereford, whom they doted on,
       And bless'd and grac'd indeed more than the King. 2345
       But this is mere digression from my purpose.
       Here come I from our princely general
       To know your griefs; to tell you from his Grace
       That he will give you audience; and wherein
       It shall appear that your demands are just, 2350
       You shall enjoy them, everything set off
       That might so much as think you enemies.

     * Lord Mowbray. But he hath forc'd us to compel this offer;
       And it proceeds from policy, not love.

     * Earl of Westmoreland. Mowbray. you overween to take it so. 2355
       This offer comes from mercy, not from fear;
       For, lo! within a ken our army lies-
       Upon mine honour, all too confident
       To give admittance to a thought of fear.
       Our battle is more full of names than yours, 2360
       Our men more perfect in the use of arms,
       Our armour all as strong, our cause the best;
       Then reason will our hearts should be as good.
       Say you not, then, our offer is compell'd.

     * Lord Mowbray. Well, by my will we shall admit no parley. 2365

     * Earl of Westmoreland. That argues but the shame of your offence:
       A rotten case abides no handling.

     * Lord Hastings. Hath the Prince John a full commission,
       In very ample virtue of his father,
       To hear and absolutely to determine 2370
       Of what conditions we shall stand upon?

     * Earl of Westmoreland. That is intended in the general's name.
       I muse you make so slight a question.

     * Archbishop Scroop. Then take, my Lord of Westmoreland, this
       schedule,
       For this contains our general grievances. 2375
       Each several article herein redress'd,
       All members of our cause, both here and hence,
       That are insinewed to this action,
       Acquitted by a true substantial form,
       And present execution of our wills 2380
       To us and to our purposes confin'd-
       We come within our awful banks again,
       And knit our powers to the arm of peace.

     * Earl of Westmoreland. This will I show the general. Please you,
       lords,
       In sight of both our battles we may meet; 2385
       And either end in peace—which God so frame!-
       Or to the place of diff'rence call the swords
       Which must decide it.

     * Archbishop Scroop. My lord, we will do so. Exit WESTMORELAND

     * Lord Mowbray. There is a thing within my bosom tells me 2390
       That no conditions of our peace can stand.

     * Lord Hastings. Fear you not that: if we can make our peace
       Upon such large terms and so absolute
       As our conditions shall consist upon,
       Our peace shall stand as firm as rocky mountains. 2395

     * Lord Mowbray. Yea, but our valuation shall be such
       That every slight and false-derived cause,
       Yea, every idle, nice, and wanton reason,
       Shall to the King taste of this action;
       That, were our royal faiths martyrs in love, 2400
       We shall be winnow'd with so rough a wind
       That even our corn shall seem as light as chaff,
       And good from bad find no partition.

     * Archbishop Scroop. No, no, my lord. Note this: the King is weary
       Of dainty and such picking grievances; 2405
       For he hath found to end one doubt by death
       Revives two greater in the heirs of life;
       And therefore will he wipe his tables clean,
       And keep no tell-tale to his memory
       That may repeat and history his los 2410
       To new remembrance. For full well he knows
       He cannot so precisely weed this land
       As his misdoubts present occasion:
       His foes are so enrooted with his friends
       That, plucking to unfix an enemy, 2415
       He doth unfasten so and shake a friend.
       So that this land, like an offensive wife
       That hath enrag'd him on to offer strokes,
       As he is striking, holds his infant up,
       And hangs resolv'd correction in the arm 2420
       That was uprear'd to execution.

     * Lord Hastings. Besides, the King hath wasted all his rods
       On late offenders, that he now doth lack
       The very instruments of chastisement;
       So that his power, like to a fangless lion, 2425
       May offer, but not hold.

     * Archbishop Scroop. 'Tis very true;
       And therefore be assur'd, my good Lord Marshal,
       If we do now make our atonement well,
       Our peace will, like a broken limb united, 2430
       Grow stronger for the breaking.

     * Lord Mowbray. Be it so.
       Here is return'd my Lord of Westmoreland.

   Re-enter WESTMORELAND
     * Earl of Westmoreland. The Prince is here at hand. Pleaseth your
       2435
       To meet his Grace just distance 'tween our armies?

     * Lord Mowbray. Your Grace of York, in God's name then, set forward.

     * Archbishop Scroop. Before, and greet his Grace. My lord, we come.

   Exeunt

   Act IV, Scene 2

   Another part of the forest
   _______________________________________________________________________

   Enter, from one side, MOWBRAY, attended; afterwards, the ARCHBISHOP,
   HASTINGS, and others; from the other side, PRINCE JOHN of LANCASTER,
   WESTMORELAND, OFFICERS, and others
     * Prince John. You are well encount'red here, my cousin Mowbray.
       Good day to you, gentle Lord Archbishop;
       And so to you, Lord Hastings, and to all.
       My Lord of York, it better show'd with you 2445
       When that your flock, assembled by the bell,
       Encircled you to hear with reverence
       Your exposition on the holy text
       Than now to see you here an iron man,
       Cheering a rout of rebels with your drum, 2450
       Turning the word to sword, and life to death.
       That man that sits within a monarch's heart
       And ripens in the sunshine of his favour,
       Would he abuse the countenance of the king,
       Alack, what mischiefs might he set abroach 2455
       In shadow of such greatness! With you, Lord Bishop,
       It is even so. Who hath not heard it spoken
       How deep you were within the books of God?
       To us the speaker in His parliament,
       To us th' imagin'd voice of God himself, 2460
       The very opener and intelligencer
       Between the grace, the sanctities of heaven,
       And our dull workings. O, who shall believe
       But you misuse the reverence of your place,
       Employ the countenance and grace of heav'n 2465
       As a false favourite doth his prince's name,
       In deeds dishonourable? You have ta'en up,
       Under the counterfeited zeal of God,
       The subjects of His substitute, my father,
       And both against the peace of heaven and him 2470
       Have here up-swarm'd them.

     * Archbishop Scroop. Good my Lord of Lancaster,
       I am not here against your father's peace;
       But, as I told my Lord of Westmoreland,
       The time misord'red doth, in common sense, 2475
       Crowd us and crush us to this monstrous form
       To hold our safety up. I sent your Grace
       The parcels and particulars of our grief,
       The which hath been with scorn shov'd from the court,
       Whereon this hydra son of war is born; 2480
       Whose dangerous eyes may well be charm'd asleep
       With grant of our most just and right desires;
       And true obedience, of this madness cur'd,
       Stoop tamely to the foot of majesty.

     * Lord Mowbray. If not, we ready are to try our fortunes 2485
       To the last man.

     * Lord Hastings. And though we here fall down,
       We have supplies to second our attempt.
       If they miscarry, theirs shall second them;
       And so success of mischief shall be born, 2490
       And heir from heir shall hold this quarrel up
       Whiles England shall have generation.

     * Prince John. YOU are too shallow, Hastings, much to shallow,
       To sound the bottom of the after-times.

     * Earl of Westmoreland. Pleaseth your Grace to answer them directly
       2495
       How far forth you do like their articles.

     * Prince John. I like them all and do allow them well;
       And swear here, by the honour of my blood,
       My father's purposes have been mistook;
       And some about him have too lavishly 2500
       Wrested his meaning and authority.
       My lord, these griefs shall be with speed redress'd;
       Upon my soul, they shall. If this may please you,
       Discharge your powers unto their several counties,
       As we will ours; and here, between the armies, 2505
       Let's drink together friendly and embrace,
       That all their eyes may bear those tokens home
       Of our restored love and amity.

     * Archbishop Scroop. I take your princely word for these redresses.

     * Prince John. I give it you, and will maintain my word; 2510
       And thereupon I drink unto your Grace.

     * Lord Hastings. Go, Captain, and deliver to the army
       This news of peace. Let them have pay, and part.
       I know it will please them. Hie thee, Captain.

   Exit Officer
     * Archbishop Scroop. To you, my noble Lord of Westmoreland.

     * Earl of Westmoreland. I pledge your Grace; and if you knew what
       pains
       I have bestow'd to breed this present peace,
       You would drink freely; but my love to ye
       Shall show itself more openly hereafter. 2520

     * Archbishop Scroop. I do not doubt you.

     * Earl of Westmoreland. I am glad of it.
       Health to my lord and gentle cousin, Mowbray.

     * Lord Mowbray. You wish me health in very happy season,
       For I am on the sudden something ill. 2525

     * Archbishop Scroop. Against ill chances men are ever merry;
       But heaviness foreruns the good event.

     * Earl of Westmoreland. Therefore be merry, coz; since sudden sorrow
       Serves to say thus, 'Some good thing comes to-morrow.'

     * Archbishop Scroop. Believe me, I am passing light in spirit. 2530

     * Lord Mowbray. So much the worse, if your own rule be true.

   [Shouts within]
     * Prince John. The word of peace is rend'red. Hark, how they

     * Lord Mowbray. This had been cheerful after victory. 2535

     * Archbishop Scroop. A peace is of the nature of a conquest;
       For then both parties nobly are subdu'd,
       And neither party loser.

     * Prince John. Go, my lord,
       And let our army be discharged too. 2540
       [Exit WESTMORELAND]
       And, good my lord, so please you let our trains
       March by us, that we may peruse the men
       We should have cop'd withal.

     * Archbishop Scroop. Go, good Lord Hastings, 2545
       And, ere they be dismiss'd, let them march by.

   Exit HASTINGS
     * Prince John. I trust, lords, we shall lie to-night together.
       [Re-enter WESTMORELAND]
       Now, cousin, wherefore stands our army still? 2550

     * Earl of Westmoreland. The leaders, having charge from you to stand,
       Will not go off until they hear you speak.

     * Prince John. They know their duties.

   Re-enter HASTINGS
     * Lord Hastings. My lord, our army is dispers'd already. 2555
       Like youthful steers unyok'd, they take their courses
       East, west, north, south; or like a school broke up,
       Each hurries toward his home and sporting-place.

     * Earl of Westmoreland. Good tidings, my Lord Hastings; for the which
       I do arrest thee, traitor, of high treason; 2560
       And you, Lord Archbishop, and you, Lord Mowbray,
       Of capital treason I attach you both.

     * Lord Mowbray. Is this proceeding just and honourable?

     * Earl of Westmoreland. Is your assembly so?

     * Archbishop Scroop. Will you thus break your faith? 2565

     * Prince John. I pawn'd thee none:
       I promis'd you redress of these same grievances
       Whereof you did complain; which, by mine honour,
       I will perform with a most Christian care.
       But for you, rebels—look to taste the due 2570
       Meet for rebellion and such acts as yours.
       Most shallowly did you these arms commence,
       Fondly brought here, and foolishly sent hence.
       Strike up our drums, pursue the scatt'red stray.
       God, and not we, hath safely fought to-day. 2575
       Some guard these traitors to the block of death,
       Treason's true bed and yielder-up of breath. Exeunt

   Alarum; excursions. Enter FALSTAFF and COLVILLE, meeting
     * Falstaff. What's your name, sir? Of what condition are you, and
       what place, I pray? 2580

     * Sir John Colville. I am a knight sir; and my name is Colville of
       the

     * Falstaff. Well then, Colville is your name, a knight is your
       degree, and your place the Dale. Colville shall still be your 2585
       name, a traitor your degree, and the dungeon your place—a
       deep enough; so shall you be still Colville of the Dale.

     * Sir John Colville. Are not you Sir John Falstaff?

     * Falstaff. As good a man as he, sir, whoe'er I am. Do you yield,
       2590
       sir, or shall I sweat for you? If I do sweat, they are the
       of thy lovers, and they weep for thy death; therefore rouse
       fear and trembling, and do observance to my mercy.

     * Sir John Colville. I think you are Sir John Falstaff, and in that
       yield me.

     * Falstaff. I have a whole school of tongues in this belly of
       and not a tongue of them all speaks any other word but my 2600
       An I had but a belly of any indifferency, I were simply the
       active fellow in Europe. My womb, my womb, my womb undoes me.
       Here comes our general.

   Enter PRINCE JOHN OF LANCASTER, WESTMORELAND, BLUNT, and others
     * Prince John. The heat is past; follow no further now.
       Call in the powers, good cousin Westmoreland.
       [Exit WESTMORELAND] 2610
       Now, Falstaff, where have you been all this while?
       When everything is ended, then you come.
       These tardy tricks of yours will, on my life,
       One time or other break some gallows' back.

     * Falstaff. I would be sorry, my lord, but it should be thus: I 2615
       knew yet but rebuke and check was the reward of valour. Do
       think me a swallow, an arrow, or a bullet? Have I, in my poor
       old motion, the expedition of thought? I have speeded hither
       the very extremest inch of possibility; I have found'red nine
       score and odd posts; and here, travel tainted as I am, have, 2620
       my pure and immaculate valour, taken Sir John Colville of the
       Dale,a most furious knight and valorous enemy. But what of
       He saw me, and yielded; that I may justly say with the
       fellow of Rome-I came, saw, and overcame.

     * Prince John. It was more of his courtesy than your deserving.

     * Falstaff. I know not. Here he is, and here I yield him; and I
       beseech your Grace, let it be book'd with the rest of this
       deeds; or, by the Lord, I will have it in a particular ballad 2635
       else, with mine own picture on the top on't, Colville kissing
       foot; to the which course if I be enforc'd, if you do not all
       show like gilt twopences to me, and I, in the clear sky of
       o'ershine you as much as the full moon doth the cinders of
       element, which show like pins' heads to her, believe not the 2640
       of the noble. Therefore let me have right, and let desert

     * Prince John. Thine's too heavy to mount.

     * Falstaff. Let it shine, then.

     * Prince John. Thine's too thick to shine. 2650

     * Falstaff. Let it do something, my good lord, that may do me
       and call it what you will.

     * Prince John. Is thy name Colville?

     * Sir John Colville. It is, my lord. 2655

     * Prince John. A famous rebel art thou, Colville.

     * Falstaff. And a famous true subject took him.

     * Sir John Colville. I am, my lord, but as my betters are
       That led me hither. Had they been rul'd by me,
       You should have won them dearer than you have. 2660

     * Falstaff. I know not how they sold themselves; but thou, like a
       kind fellow, gavest thyself away gratis; and I thank thee for
       thee.

   Re-enter WESTMORELAND
     * Prince John. Now, have you left pursuit? 2665

     * Earl of Westmoreland. Retreat is made, and execution stay'd.

     * Prince John. Send Colville, with his confederates,
       To York, to present execution.
       Blunt, lead him hence; and see you guard him sure.
       [Exeunt BLUNT and others] 2670
       And now dispatch we toward the court, my lords.
       I hear the King my father is sore sick.
       Our news shall go before us to his Majesty,
       Which, cousin, you shall bear to comfort him
       And we with sober speed will follow you. 2675

     * Falstaff. My lord, I beseech you, give me leave to go through
       Gloucestershire; and, when you come to court, stand my good
       pray, in your good report.

     * Prince John. Fare you well, Falstaff. I, in my condition, 2680
       Shall better speak of you than you deserve.

   Exeunt all but FALSTAFF
     * Falstaff. I would you had but the wit; 'twere better than your
       dukedom. Good faith, this same young sober-blooded boy doth
       love me; nor a man cannot make him laugh—but that's no 2685
       he drinks no wine. There's never none of these demure boys
       to any proof; for thin drink doth so over-cool their blood,
       making many fish-meals, that they fall into a kind of male
       green-sickness; and then, when they marry, they get wenches.
       are generally fools and cowards-which some of us should be 2690
       but for inflammation. A good sherris-sack hath a two-fold
       operation in it. It ascends me into the brain; dries me there
       the foolish and dull and crudy vapours which environ it;
       apprehensive, quick, forgetive, full of nimble, fiery, and
       delectable shapes; which delivered o'er to the voice, the 2695
       which is the birth, becomes excellent wit. The second
       your excellent sherris is the warming of the blood; which
       cold and settled, left the liver white and pale, which is the
       badge of pusillanimity and cowardice; but the sherris warms
       and makes it course from the inwards to the parts extremes. 2700
       illumineth the face, which, as a beacon, gives warning to all
       rest of this little kingdom, man, to arm; and then the vital
       commoners and inland petty spirits muster me all to their
       captain, the heart, who, great and puff'd up with this
       doth any deed of courage—and this valour comes of sherris. 2705
       that skill in the weapon is nothing without sack, for that
       it a-work; and learning, a mere hoard of gold kept by a devil
       till sack commences it and sets it in act and use. Hereof
       it that Prince Harry is valiant; for the cold blood he did
       naturally inherit of his father, he hath, like lean, sterile, 2710
       bare land, manured, husbanded, and till'd, with excellent
       endeavour of drinking good and good store of fertile sherris,
       that he is become very hot and valiant. If I had a thousand
       the first humane principle I would teach them should be to
       forswear thin potations and to addict themselves to sack. 2715
       [Enter BARDOLPH]
       How now, Bardolph!

     * Bardolph. The army is discharged all and gone.

     * Falstaff. Let them go. I'll through Gloucestershire, and there
       I visit Master Robert Shallow, Esquire. I have him already 2740
       temp'ring between my finger and my thumb, and shortly will I
       with him. Come away. Exeunt

   Act IV, Scene 4

   Westminster. The Jerusalem Chamber
   _______________________________________________________________________

   Enter the KING, PRINCE THOMAS OF CLARENCE, PRINCE HUMPHREY OF
   GLOUCESTER, WARWICK, and others
     * Henry IV. Now, lords, if God doth give successful end
       To this debate that bleedeth at our doors,
       We will our youth lead on to higher fields,
       And draw no swords but what are sanctified.
       Our navy is address'd, our power connected, 2750
       Our substitutes in absence well invested,
       And everything lies level to our wish.
       Only we want a little personal strength;
       And pause us till these rebels, now afoot,
       Come underneath the yoke of government. 2755

     * Earl of Warwick. Both which we doubt not but your Majesty
       Shall soon enjoy.

     * Henry IV. Humphrey, my son of Gloucester,
       Where is the Prince your brother?

     * Prince Humphrey. I think he's gone to hunt, my lord, at 2760

     * Henry IV. And how accompanied?

     * Prince Humphrey. I do not know, my lord.

     * Henry IV. Is not his brother, Thomas of Clarence, with him?

     * Prince Humphrey. No, my good lord, he is in presence here. 2765

     * Prince Thomas. What would my lord and father?

     * Henry IV. Nothing but well to thee, Thomas of Clarence.
       How chance thou art not with the Prince thy brother?
       He loves thee, and thou dost neglect him, Thomas.
       Thou hast a better place in his affection 2770
       Than all thy brothers; cherish it, my boy,
       And noble offices thou mayst effect
       Of mediation, after I am dead,
       Between his greatness and thy other brethren.
       Therefore omit him not; blunt not his love, 2775
       Nor lose the good advantage of his grace
       By seeming cold or careless of his will;
       For he is gracious if he be observ'd.
       He hath a tear for pity and a hand
       Open as day for melting charity; 2780
       Yet notwithstanding, being incens'd, he is flint;
       As humorous as winter, and as sudden
       As flaws congealed in the spring of day.
       His temper, therefore, must be well observ'd.
       Chide him for faults, and do it reverently, 2785
       When you perceive his blood inclin'd to mirth;
       But, being moody, give him line and scope
       Till that his passions, like a whale on ground,
       Confound themselves with working. Learn this, Thomas,
       And thou shalt prove a shelter to thy friends, 2790
       A hoop of gold to bind thy brothers in,
       That the united vessel of their blood,
       Mingled with venom of suggestion—
       As, force perforce, the age will pour it in—
       Shall never leak, though it do work as strong 2795
       As aconitum or rash gunpowder.

     * Prince Thomas. I shall observe him with all care and love.

     * Henry IV. Why art thou not at Windsor with him, Thomas?

     * Prince Thomas. He is not there to-day; he dines in London.

     * Henry IV. And how accompanied? Canst thou tell that? 2800

     * Prince Thomas. With Poins, and other his continual followers.

     * Henry IV. Most subject is the fattest soil to weeds;
       And he, the noble image of my youth,
       Is overspread with them; therefore my grief
       Stretches itself beyond the hour of death. 2805
       The blood weeps from my heart when I do shape,
       In forms imaginary, th'unguided days
       And rotten times that you shall look upon
       When I am sleeping with my ancestors.
       For when his headstrong riot hath no curb, 2810
       When rage and hot blood are his counsellors
       When means and lavish manners meet together,
       O, with what wings shall his affections fly
       Towards fronting peril and oppos'd decay!

     * Earl of Warwick. My gracious lord, you look beyond him quite. 2815
       The Prince but studies his companions
       Like a strange tongue, wherein, to gain the language,
       'Tis needful that the most immodest word
       Be look'd upon and learnt; which once attain'd,
       Your Highness knows, comes to no further use 2820
       But to be known and hated. So, like gross terms,
       The Prince will, in the perfectness of time,
       Cast off his followers; and their memory
       Shall as a pattern or a measure live
       By which his Grace must mete the lives of other, 2825
       Turning past evils to advantages.

     * Henry IV. 'Tis seldom when the bee doth leave her comb
       In the dead carrion.
       [Enter WESTMORELAND]
       Who's here? Westmoreland? 2830

     * Earl of Westmoreland. Health to my sovereign, and new happiness
       Added to that that am to deliver!
       Prince John, your son, doth kiss your Grace's hand.
       Mowbray, the Bishop Scroop, Hastings, and all,
       Are brought to the correction of your law. 2835
       There is not now a rebel's sword unsheath'd,
       But Peace puts forth her olive everywhere.
       The manner how this action hath been borne
       Here at more leisure may your Highness read,
       With every course in his particular. 2840

     * Henry IV. O Westmoreland, thou art a summer bird,
       Which ever in the haunch of winter sings
       The lifting up of day.
       [Enter HARCOURT]
       Look here's more news. 2845

     * Harcourt. From enemies heaven keep your Majesty;
       And, when they stand against you, may they fall
       As those that I am come to tell you of!
       The Earl Northumberland and the Lord Bardolph,
       With a great power of English and of Scots, 2850
       Are by the shrieve of Yorkshire overthrown.
       The manner and true order of the fight
       This packet, please it you, contains at large.

     * Henry IV. And wherefore should these good news make me sick?
       Will Fortune never come with both hands full, 2855
       But write her fair words still in foulest letters?
       She either gives a stomach and no food-
       Such are the poor, in health—or else a feast,
       And takes away the stomach—such are the rich
       That have abundance and enjoy it not. 2860
       I should rejoice now at this happy news;
       And now my sight fails, and my brain is giddy.
       O me! come near me now I am much ill.

     * Prince Humphrey. Comfort, your Majesty!

     * Prince Thomas. O my royal father! 2865

     * Earl of Westmoreland. My sovereign lord, cheer up yourself, look
       up.

     * Earl of Warwick. Be patient, Princes; you do know these fits
       Are with his Highness very ordinary.
       Stand from him, give him air; he'll straight be well.

     * Prince Thomas. No, no; he cannot long hold out these pangs. 2870
       Th' incessant care and labour of his mind
       Hath wrought the mure that should confine it in
       So thin that life looks through, and will break out.

     * Prince Humphrey. The people fear me; for they do observe
       Unfather'd heirs and loathly births of nature. 2875
       The seasons change their manners, as the year
       Had found some months asleep, and leapt them over.

     * Prince Thomas. The river hath thrice flow'd, no ebb between;
       And the old folk, Time's doting chronicles,
       Say it did so a little time before 2880
       That our great grandsire, Edward, sick'd and died.

     * Earl of Warwick. Speak lower, Princes, for the King recovers.

     * Prince Humphrey. This apoplexy will certain be his end.

     * Henry IV. I pray you take me up, and bear me hence
       Into some other chamber. Softly, pray. Exeunt 2885

   Act IV, Scene 5

   Westminster. Another chamber
   _______________________________________________________________________

   The KING lying on a bed; CLARENCE, GLOUCESTER, WARWICK, and others in
   attendance
     * Henry IV. Let there be no noise made, my gentle friends;
       Unless some dull and favourable hand
       Will whisper music to my weary spirit.

     * Earl of Warwick. Call for the music in the other room. 2890

     * Henry IV. Set me the crown upon my pillow here.

     * Prince Thomas. His eye is hollow, and he changes much.

     * Earl of Warwick. Less noise! less noise!

   Enter PRINCE HENRY
     * Henry V. Who saw the Duke of Clarence? 2895

     * Prince Thomas. I am here, brother, full of heaviness.

     * Henry V. How now! Rain within doors, and none abroad!
       How doth the King?

     * Prince Humphrey. Exceeding ill.

     * Henry V. Heard he the good news yet? Tell it him. 2900

     * Prince Humphrey. He alt'red much upon the hearing it.

     * Henry V. If he be sick with joy, he'll recover without physic.

     * Earl of Warwick. Not so much noise, my lords. Sweet Prince, speak
       low;
       The King your father is dispos'd to sleep.

     * Prince Thomas. Let us withdraw into the other room. 2905

     * Earl of Warwick. Will't please your Grace to go along with us?

     * Henry V. No; I will sit and watch here by the King.
       [Exeunt all but the PRINCE]
       Why doth the crown lie there upon his pillow,
       Being so troublesome a bedfellow? 2910
       O polish'd perturbation! golden care!
       That keep'st the ports of slumber open wide
       To many a watchful night! Sleep with it now!
       Yet not so sound and half so deeply sweet
       As he whose brow with homely biggen bound 2915
       Snores out the watch of night. O majesty!
       When thou dost pinch thy bearer, thou dost sit
       Like a rich armour worn in heat of day
       That scald'st with safety. By his gates of breath
       There lies a downy feather which stirs not. 2920
       Did he suspire, that light and weightless down
       Perforce must move. My gracious lord! my father!
       This sleep is sound indeed; this is a sleep
       That from this golden rigol hath divorc'd
       So many English kings. Thy due from me 2925
       Is tears and heavy sorrows of the blood
       Which nature, love, and filial tenderness,
       Shall, O dear father, pay thee plenteously.
       My due from thee is this imperial crown,
       Which, as immediate from thy place and blood, 2930
       Derives itself to me. [Putting on the crown] Lo where it
       Which God shall guard; and put the world's whole strength
       Into one giant arm, it shall not force
       This lineal honour from me. This from thee
       Will I to mine leave as 'tis left to me. Exit 2935

     * Henry IV. Warwick! Gloucester! Clarence!

   Re-enter WARWICK, GLOUCESTER, CLARENCE
     * Prince Thomas. Doth the King call?

     * Earl of Warwick. What would your Majesty? How fares your Grace?
       2940

     * Henry IV. Why did you leave me here alone, my lords?

     * Prince Thomas. We left the Prince my brother here, my liege,
       Who undertook to sit and watch by you.

     * Henry IV. The Prince of Wales! Where is he? Let me see him.
       He is not here. 2945

     * Earl of Warwick. This door is open; he is gone this way.

     * Prince Humphrey. He came not through the chamber where we

     * Henry IV. Where is the crown? Who took it from my pillow?

     * Earl of Warwick. When we withdrew, my liege, we left it here. 2950

     * Henry IV. The Prince hath ta'en it hence. Go, seek him out.
       Is he so hasty that he doth suppose
       My sleep my death?
       Find him, my lord of Warwick; chide him hither.
       [Exit WARWICK] 2955
       This part of his conjoins with my disease
       And helps to end me. See, sons, what things you are!
       How quickly nature falls into revolt
       When gold becomes her object!
       For this the foolish over-careful fathers 2960
       Have broke their sleep with thoughts,
       Their brains with care, their bones with industry;
       For this they have engrossed and pil'd up
       The cank'red heaps of strange-achieved gold;
       For this they have been thoughtful to invest 2965
       Their sons with arts and martial exercises;
       When, like the bee, tolling from every flower
       The virtuous sweets,
       Our thighs with wax, our mouths with honey pack'd,
       We bring it to the hive, and, like the bees, 2970
       Are murd'red for our pains. This bitter taste
       Yields his engrossments to the ending father.
       [Re-enter WARWICK]
       Now where is he that will not stay so long
       Till his friend sickness hath determin'd me? 2975

     * Earl of Warwick. My lord, I found the Prince in the next room,
       Washing with kindly tears his gentle cheeks,
       With such a deep demeanour in great sorrow,
       That tyranny, which never quaff'd but blood,
       Would, by beholding him, have wash'd his knife 2980
       With gentle eye-drops. He is coming hither.

     * Henry IV. But wherefore did he take away the crown?
       [Re-enter PRINCE HENRY]
       Lo where he comes. Come hither to me, Harry.
       Depart the chamber, leave us here alone. 2985

   Exeunt all but the KING and the PRINCE
     * Henry V. I never thought to hear you speak again.

     * Henry IV. Thy wish was father, Harry, to that thought.
       I stay too long by thee, I weary thee.
       Dost thou so hunger for mine empty chair 2990
       That thou wilt needs invest thee with my honours
       Before thy hour be ripe? O foolish youth!
       Thou seek'st the greatness that will overwhelm thee.
       Stay but a little, for my cloud of dignity
       Is held from falling with so weak a wind 2995
       That it will quickly drop; my day is dim.
       Thou hast stol'n that which, after some few hours,
       Were thine without offense; and at my death
       Thou hast seal'd up my expectation.
       Thy life did manifest thou lov'dst me not, 3000
       And thou wilt have me die assur'd of it.
       Thou hid'st a thousand daggers in thy thoughts,
       Which thou hast whetted on thy stony heart,
       To stab at half an hour of my life.
       What, canst thou not forbear me half an hour? 3005
       Then get thee gone, and dig my grave thyself;
       And bid the merry bells ring to thine ear
       That thou art crowned, not that I am dead.
       Let all the tears that should bedew my hearse
       Be drops of balm to sanctify thy head; 3010
       Only compound me with forgotten dust;
       Give that which gave thee life unto the worms.
       Pluck down my officers, break my decrees;
       For now a time is come to mock at form-
       Harry the Fifth is crown'd. Up, vanity: 3015
       Down, royal state. All you sage counsellors, hence.
       And to the English court assemble now,
       From every region, apes of idleness.
       Now, neighbour confines, purge you of your scum.
       Have you a ruffian that will swear, drink, dance, 3020
       Revel the night, rob, murder, and commit
       The oldest sins the newest kind of ways?
       Be happy, he will trouble you no more.
       England shall double gild his treble guilt;
       England shall give him office, honour, might; 3025
       For the fifth Harry from curb'd license plucks
       The muzzle of restraint, and the wild dog
       Shall flesh his tooth on every innocent.
       O my poor kingdom, sick with civil blows!
       When that my care could not withhold thy riots, 3030
       What wilt thou do when riot is thy care?
       O, thou wilt be a wilderness again.
       Peopled with wolves, thy old inhabitants!

     * Henry V. O, pardon me, my liege! But for my tears,
       The moist impediments unto my speech, 3035
       I had forestall'd this dear and deep rebuke
       Ere you with grief had spoke and I had heard
       The course of it so far. There is your crown,
       And he that wears the crown immortally
       Long guard it yours! [Kneeling] If I affect it more 3040
       Than as your honour and as your renown,
       Let me no more from this obedience rise,
       Which my most inward true and duteous spirit
       Teacheth this prostrate and exterior bending!
       God witness with me, when I here came in 3045
       And found no course of breath within your Majesty,
       How cold it struck my heart! If I do feign,
       O, let me in my present wildness die,
       And never live to show th' incredulous world
       The noble change that I have purposed! 3050
       Coming to look on you, thinking you dead-
       And dead almost, my liege, to think you were-
       I spake unto this crown as having sense,
       And thus upbraided it: 'The care on thee depending
       Hath fed upon the body of my father; 3055
       Therefore thou best of gold art worst of gold.
       Other, less fine in carat, is more precious,
       Preserving life in med'cine potable;
       But thou, most fine, most honour'd, most renown'd,
       Hast eat thy bearer up.' Thus, my most royal liege, 3060
       Accusing it, I put it on my head,
       To try with it—as with an enemy
       That had before my face murd'red my father—
       The quarrel of a true inheritor.
       But if it did infect my blood with joy, 3065
       Or swell my thoughts to any strain of pride;
       If any rebel or vain spirit of mine
       Did with the least affection of a welcome
       Give entertainment to the might of it,
       Let God for ever keep it from my head, 3070
       And make me as the poorest vassal is,
       That doth with awe and terror kneel to it!

     * Henry IV. O my son,
       God put it in thy mind to take it hence,
       That thou mightst win the more thy father's love, 3075
       Pleading so wisely in excuse of it!
       Come hither, Harry; sit thou by my bed,
       And hear, I think, the very latest counsel
       That ever I shall breathe. God knows, my son,
       By what by-paths and indirect crook'd ways 3080
       I met this crown; and I myself know well
       How troublesome it sat upon my head:
       To thee it shall descend with better quiet,
       Better opinion, better confirmation;
       For all the soil of the achievement goes 3085
       With me into the earth. It seem'd in me
       But as an honour snatch'd with boist'rous hand;
       And I had many living to upbraid
       My gain of it by their assistances;
       Which daily grew to quarrel and to bloodshed, 3090
       Wounding supposed peace. All these bold fears
       Thou seest with peril I have answered;
       For all my reign hath been but as a scene
       Acting that argument. And now my death
       Changes the mood; for what in me was purchas'd 3095
       Falls upon thee in a more fairer sort;
       So thou the garland wear'st successively.
       Yet, though thou stand'st more sure than I could do,
       Thou art not firm enough, since griefs are green;
       And all my friends, which thou must make thy friends, 3100
       Have but their stings and teeth newly ta'en out;
       By whose fell working I was first advanc'd,
       And by whose power I well might lodge a fear
       To be again displac'd; which to avoid,
       I cut them off; and had a purpose now 3105
       To lead out many to the Holy Land,
       Lest rest and lying still might make them look
       Too near unto my state. Therefore, my Harry,
       Be it thy course to busy giddy minds
       With foreign quarrels, that action, hence borne out, 3110
       May waste the memory of the former days.
       More would I, but my lungs are wasted so
       That strength of speech is utterly denied me.
       How I came by the crown, O God, forgive;
       And grant it may with thee in true peace live! 3115

     * Henry V. My gracious liege,
       You won it, wore it, kept it, gave it me;
       Then plain and right must my possession be;
       Which I with more than with a common pain
       'Gainst all the world will rightfully maintain. 3120
       Enter PRINCE JOHN OF LANCASTER, WARWICK, LORDS, and others

     * Henry IV. Look, look, here comes my John of Lancaster.

     * Prince John. Health, peace, and happiness, to my royal father!

     * Henry IV. Thou bring'st me happiness and peace, son John;
       But health, alack, with youthful wings is flown 3125
       From this bare wither'd trunk. Upon thy sight
       My worldly business makes a period.
       Where is my Lord of Warwick?

     * Henry V. My Lord of Warwick!

     * Henry IV. Doth any name particular belong 3130
       Unto the lodging where I first did swoon?

     * Earl of Warwick. 'Tis call'd Jerusalem, my noble lord.

     * Henry IV. Laud be to God! Even there my life must end.
       It hath been prophesied to me many years,
       I should not die but in Jerusalem; 3135
       Which vainly I suppos'd the Holy Land.
       But bear me to that chamber; there I'll lie;
       In that Jerusalem shall Harry die. Exeunt

   Act V, Scene 1

   Gloucestershire. SHALLOW’S house
   _______________________________________________________________________

   Enter SHALLOW, FALSTAFF, BARDOLPH, and PAGE
     * Robert Shallow. By cock and pie, sir, you shall not away to-night.
       3140
       What, Davy, I say!

     * Falstaff. You must excuse me, Master Robert Shallow.

     * Robert Shallow. I will not excuse you; you shall not be excus'd;
       shall not be admitted; there is no excuse shall serve; you
       not be excus'd. Why, Davy! 3145

   Enter DAVY
     * Davy. Here, sir.

     * Robert Shallow. Davy, Davy, Davy, Davy; let me see, Davy; let me
       see, 3150
       Davy; let me see—yea, marry, William cook, bid him come
       Sir John, you shall not be excus'd.

     * Davy. Marry, sir, thus: those precepts cannot be served; and,
       again, sir—shall we sow the headland with wheat? 3155

     * Robert Shallow. With red wheat, Davy. But for William cook—are
       there
       young pigeons?

     * Davy. Yes, sir. Here is now the smith's note for shoeing and
       plough-irons. 3160

     * Robert Shallow. Let it be cast, and paid. Sir John, you shall not
       be
       excused.

     * Davy. Now, sir, a new link to the bucket must needs be had;
       sir, do you mean to stop any of William's wages about the
       lost the other day at Hinckley fair? 3165

     * Robert Shallow. 'A shall answer it. Some pigeons, Davy, a couple of
       short-legg'd hens, a joint of mutton, and any pretty little
       kickshaws, tell William cook. 3170

     * Davy. Doth the man of war stay all night, sir?

     * Robert Shallow. Yea, Davy; I will use him well. A friend i' th'
       court
       better than a penny in purse. Use his men well, Davy; for
       are arrant knaves and will backbite. 3175

     * Davy. No worse than they are backbitten, sir; for they have
       marvellous foul linen.

     * Robert Shallow. Well conceited, Davy—about thy business, Davy. 3180

     * Davy. I beseech you, sir, to countenance William Visor of
       against Clement Perkes o' th' hill.

     * Robert Shallow. There, is many complaints, Davy, against that
       Visor.
       Visor is an arrant knave, on my knowledge. 3185

     * Davy. I grant your worship that he is a knave, sir; but yet God
       forbid, sir, but a knave should have some countenance at his
       friend's request. An honest man, sir, is able to speak for
       himself, when a knave is not. I have serv'd your worship 3190
       sir, this eight years; an I cannot once or twice in a quarter
       bear out a knave against an honest man, I have but a very
       credit with your worship. The knave is mine honest friend,
       therefore, I beseech you, let him be countenanc'd.

     * Robert Shallow. Go to; I say he shall have no wrong. Look about,

     * Davy. [Exit DAVY] Where are you, Sir John? Come, come, come,
       with your boots. Give me your hand, Master Bardolph. 3200

     * Bardolph. I am glad to see your worship.

     * Robert Shallow. I thank thee with all my heart, kind Master
       Bardolph.
       [To the PAGE] And welcome, my tall fellow. Come, Sir John.

     * Falstaff. I'll follow you, good Master Robert Shallow. 3205
       [Exit SHALLOW] Bardolph, look to our horses. [Exeunt
       and PAGE] If I were sawed into quantities, I should make
       dozen of such bearded hermits' staves as Master Shallow. It
       wonderful thing to see the semblable coherence of his men's
       spirits and his. They, by observing of him, do bear 3210
       like foolish justices: he, by conversing with them, is turned
       into a justice-like serving-man. Their spirits are so married
       conjunction with the participation of society that they flock
       together in consent, like so many wild geese. If I had a suit
       Master Shallow, I would humour his men with the imputation of 3215
       being near their master; if to his men, I would curry with
       Shallow that no man could better command his servants. It is
       certain that either wise bearing or ignorant carriage is
       as men take diseases, one of another; therefore let men take
       of their company. I will devise matter enough out of this 3220
       to keep Prince Harry in continual laughter the wearing out of
       fashions, which is four terms, or two actions; and 'a shall
       without intervallums. O, it is much that a lie with a slight
       oath, and a jest with a sad brow will do with a fellow that
       had the ache in his shoulders! O, you shall see him laugh 3225
       his face be like a wet cloak ill laid up!

     * Robert Shallow. [Within] Sir John!

     * Falstaff. I come, Master Shallow; I come, Master Shallow.

   Act V, Scene 2

   Westminster. The palace
   _______________________________________________________________________

   Enter, severally, WARWICK, and the LORD CHIEF JUSTICE
     * Earl of Warwick. How now, my Lord Chief Justice; whither away? 3245

     * Lord Chief Justice. How doth the King?

     * Earl of Warwick. Exceeding well; his cares are now all ended.

     * Lord Chief Justice. I hope, not dead.

     * Earl of Warwick. He's walk'd the way of nature;
       And to our purposes he lives no more. 3250

     * Lord Chief Justice. I would his Majesty had call'd me with him.
       The service that I truly did his life
       Hath left me open to all injuries.

     * Earl of Warwick. Indeed, I think the young king loves you not.

     * Lord Chief Justice. I know he doth not, and do arm myself 3255
       To welcome the condition of the time,
       Which cannot look more hideously upon me
       Than I have drawn it in my fantasy.

   Enter LANCASTER, CLARENCE, GLOUCESTER, WESTMORELAND, and others
     * Earl of Warwick. Here comes the heavy issue of dead Harry. 3260
       O that the living Harry had the temper
       Of he, the worst of these three gentlemen!
       How many nobles then should hold their places
       That must strike sail to spirits of vile sort!

     * Lord Chief Justice. O God, I fear all will be overturn'd. 3265

     * Prince John. Good morrow, cousin Warwick, good morrow.

     * Prince Humphrey. [with CLARENCE:] Good morrow, cousin.

     * Prince John. We meet like men that had forgot to speak.

     * Earl of Warwick. We do remember; but our argument
       Is all too heavy to admit much talk. 3270

     * Prince John. Well, peace be with him that hath made us heavy!

     * Lord Chief Justice. Peace be with us, lest we be heavier!

     * Prince Humphrey. O, good my lord, you have lost a friend
       And I dare swear you borrow not that face
       Of seeming sorrow—it is sure your own. 3275

     * Prince John. Though no man be assur'd what grace to find,
       You stand in coldest expectation.
       I am the sorrier; would 'twere otherwise.

     * Prince Thomas. Well, you must now speak Sir John Falstaff fair;
       3280
       Which swims against your stream of quality.

     * Lord Chief Justice. Sweet Princes, what I did, I did in honour,
       Led by th' impartial conduct of my soul;
       And never shall you see that I will beg
       A ragged and forestall'd remission. 3285
       If truth and upright innocency fail me,
       I'll to the King my master that is dead,
       And tell him who hath sent me after him.

     * Earl of Warwick. Here comes the Prince.

   Enter KING HENRY THE FIFTH, attended
     * Lord Chief Justice. Good morrow, and God save your Majesty!

     * Henry IV. This new and gorgeous garment, majesty,
       Sits not so easy on me as you think.
       Brothers, you mix your sadness with some fear.
       This is the English, not the Turkish court; 3295
       Not Amurath an Amurath succeeds,
       But Harry Harry. Yet be sad, good brothers,
       For, by my faith, it very well becomes you.
       Sorrow so royally in you appears
       That I will deeply put the fashion on, 3300
       And wear it in my heart. Why, then, be sad;
       But entertain no more of it, good brothers,
       Than a joint burden laid upon us all.
       For me, by heaven, I bid you be assur'd,
       I'll be your father and your brother too; 3305
       Let me but bear your love, I'll bear your cares.
       Yet weep that Harry's dead, and so will I;
       But Harry lives that shall convert those tears
       By number into hours of happiness.

     * Brothers. We hope no otherwise from your Majesty. 3310

     * Henry V. You all look strangely on me; and you most.
       You are, I think, assur'd I love you not.

     * Lord Chief Justice. I am assur'd, if I be measur'd rightly,
       Your Majesty hath no just cause to hate me.

     * Henry V. No? 3315
       How might a prince of my great hopes forget
       So great indignities you laid upon me?
       What, rate, rebuke, and roughly send to prison,
       Th' immediate heir of England! Was this easy?
       May this be wash'd in Lethe and forgotten? 3320

     * Lord Chief Justice. I then did use the person of your father;
       The image of his power lay then in me;
       And in th' administration of his law,
       Whiles I was busy for the commonwealth,
       Your Highness pleased to forget my place, 3325
       The majesty and power of law and justice,
       The image of the King whom I presented,
       And struck me in my very seat of judgment;
       Whereon, as an offender to your father,
       I gave bold way to my authority 3330
       And did commit you. If the deed were ill,
       Be you contented, wearing now the garland,
       To have a son set your decrees at nought,
       To pluck down justice from your awful bench,
       To trip the course of law, and blunt the sword 3335
       That guards the peace and safety of your person;
       Nay, more, to spurn at your most royal image,
       And mock your workings in a second body.
       Question your royal thoughts, make the case yours;
       Be now the father, and propose a son; 3340
       Hear your own dignity so much profan'd,
       See your most dreadful laws so loosely slighted,
       Behold yourself so by a son disdain'd;
       And then imagine me taking your part
       And, in your power, soft silencing your son. 3345
       After this cold considerance, sentence me;
       And, as you are a king, speak in your state
       What I have done that misbecame my place,
       My person, or my liege's sovereignty.

     * Henry V. You are right, Justice, and you weigh this well; 3350
       Therefore still bear the balance and the sword;
       And I do wish your honours may increase
       Till you do live to see a son of mine
       Offend you, and obey you, as I did.
       So shall I live to speak my father's words: 3355
       'Happy am I that have a man so bold
       That dares do justice on my proper son;
       And not less happy, having such a son
       That would deliver up his greatness so
       Into the hands of justice.' You did commit me; 3360
       For which I do commit into your hand
       Th' unstained sword that you have us'd to bear;
       With this remembrance—that you use the same
       With the like bold, just, and impartial spirit
       As you have done 'gainst me. There is my hand. 3365
       You shall be as a father to my youth;
       My voice shall sound as you do prompt mine ear;
       And I will stoop and humble my intents
       To your well-practis'd wise directions.
       And, Princes all, believe me, I beseech you, 3370
       My father is gone wild into his grave,
       For in his tomb lie my affections;
       And with his spirits sadly I survive,
       To mock the expectation of the world,
       To frustrate prophecies, and to raze out 3375
       Rotten opinion, who hath writ me down
       After my seeming. The tide of blood in me
       Hath proudly flow'd in vanity till now.
       Now doth it turn and ebb back to the sea,
       Where it shall mingle with the state of floods, 3380
       And flow henceforth in formal majesty.
       Now call we our high court of parliament;
       And let us choose such limbs of noble counsel,
       That the great body of our state may go
       In equal rank with the best govern'd nation; 3385
       That war, or peace, or both at once, may be
       As things acquainted and familiar to us;
       In which you, father, shall have foremost hand.
       Our coronation done, we will accite,
       As I before rememb'red, all our state; 3390
       And—God consigning to my good intents-
       No prince nor peer shall have just cause to say,
       God shorten Harry's happy life one day. Exeunt

   Gloucestershire. SHALLOW’S orchard
   _______________________________________________________________________

   Enter FALSTAFF, SHALLOW, SILENCE, BARDOLPH, the PAGE, and DAVY
     * Robert Shallow. Nay, you shall see my orchard, where, in an arbour,
       we 3395
       will eat a last year's pippin of mine own graffing, with a
       of caraways, and so forth. Come, cousin Silence. And then to

     * Falstaff. Fore God, you have here a goodly dwelling and rich. 3400

     * Robert Shallow. Barren, barren, barren; beggars all, beggars all,
       Sir
       -marry, good air. Spread, Davy, spread, Davy; well said,

     * Falstaff. This Davy serves you for good uses; he is your 3405
       serving-man and your husband.

     * Robert Shallow. A good varlet, a good varlet, a very good varlet,
       Sir
       John. By the mass, I have drunk too much sack at supper. A
       varlet. Now sit down, now sit down; come, cousin.

     * Silence. Ah, sirrah! quoth-a—we shall [Singing]
       Do nothing but eat and make good cheer,
       And praise God for the merry year;
       When flesh is cheap and females dear,
       And lusty lads roam here and there, 3415
       So merrily,
       And ever among so merrily.

     * Falstaff. There's a merry heart! Good Master Silence, I'll give
       a health for that anon.

     * Robert Shallow. Give Master Bardolph some wine, Davy.

     * Davy. Sweet sir, sit; I'll be with you anon; most sweet sir,
       Master Page, good Master Page, sit. Proface! What you want in
       meat, we'll have in drink. But you must bear; the heart's

     * Robert Shallow. Be merry, Master Bardolph; and, my little soldier
       be merry.

     * Silence. [Singing]
       Be merry, be merry, my wife has all;
       For women are shrews, both short and tall;
       'Tis merry in hall when beards wag an;
       And welcome merry Shrove-tide. 3435
       Be merry, be merry.

     * Falstaff. I did not think Master Silence had been a man of this
       mettle.

     * Silence. Who, I? I have been merry twice and once ere now.

   Re-enter DAVY
     * Davy. [To BARDOLPH] There's a dish of leather-coats for you.

     * Robert Shallow. Davy!

     * Davy. Your worship! I'll be with you straight. [To BARDOLPH]
       A cup of wine, sir?

     * Silence. [Singing] 3445
       A cup of wine that's brisk and fine,
       And drink unto the leman mine;
       And a merry heart lives long-a.

     * Falstaff. Well said, Master Silence.

     * Silence. An we shall be merry, now comes in the sweet o' th' 3450

     * Falstaff. Health and long life to you, Master Silence!

     * Silence. [Singing]
       Fill the cup, and let it come,
       I'll pledge you a mile to th' bottom. 3455

     * Robert Shallow. Honest Bardolph, welcome; if thou want'st anything
       and
       wilt not call, beshrew thy heart. Welcome, my little tiny
       and welcome indeed too. I'll drink to Master Bardolph, and to
       the cabileros about London.

     * Davy. I hope to see London once ere I die.

     * Bardolph. An I might see you there, Davy!

     * Robert Shallow. By the mass, you'll crack a quart together—ha! will
       not, Master Bardolph? 3465

     * Bardolph. Yea, sir, in a pottle-pot.

     * Robert Shallow. By God's liggens, I thank thee. The knave will
       stick
       thee, I can assure thee that. 'A will not out, 'a; 'tis true
       bred. 3470

     * Bardolph. And I'll stick by him, sir.

     * Robert Shallow. Why, there spoke a king. Lack nothing; be merry.
       [One knocks at door] Look who's at door there, ho! Who

   Exit DAVY
     * Falstaff. [To SILENCE, who has drunk a bumper] Why, now you
       done me right.

     * Silence. [Singing] 3480
       Do me right,
       And dub me knight.
       Samingo.
       Is't not so?

     * Falstaff. 'Tis so. 3485

     * Silence. Is't so? Why then, say an old man can do somewhat.

   Re-enter DAVY
     * Davy. An't please your worship, there's one Pistol come from
       court with news.

     * Falstaff. From the court? Let him come in.
       [Enter PISTOL]
       How now, Pistol?

     * Pistol. Sir John, God save you!

     * Falstaff. What wind blew you hither, Pistol? 3495

     * Pistol. Not the ill wind which blows no man to good. Sweet
       thou art now one of the greatest men in this realm.

     * Silence. By'r lady, I think 'a be, but goodman Puff of Barson.

     * Pistol. Puff! 3500
       Puff in thy teeth, most recreant coward base!
       Sir John, I am thy Pistol and thy friend,
       And helter-skelter have I rode to thee;
       And tidings do I bring, and lucky joys,
       And golden times, and happy news of price. 3505

     * Falstaff. I pray thee now, deliver them like a man of this

     * Pistol. A foutra for the world and worldlings base!
       I speak of Africa and golden joys.

     * Falstaff. O base Assyrian knight, what is thy news? 3510
       Let King Cophetua know the truth thereof.

     * Silence. [Singing] And Robin Hood, Scarlet, and John.

     * Pistol. Shall dunghill curs confront the Helicons?
       And shall good news be baffled?
       Then, Pistol, lay thy head in Furies' lap. 3515

     * Robert Shallow. Honest gentleman, I know not your breeding.

     * Pistol. Why, then, lament therefore.

     * Robert Shallow. Give me pardon, sir. If, sir, you come with news
       from
       court, I take it there's but two ways—either to utter them
       conceal them. I am, sir, under the King, in some authority. 3520

     * Pistol. Under which king, Bezonian? Speak, or die.

     * Robert Shallow. Under King Harry.

     * Pistol. Harry the Fourth—or Fifth? 3525

     * Robert Shallow. Harry the Fourth.

     * Pistol. A foutra for thine office!
       Sir John, thy tender lambkin now is King;
       Harry the Fifth's the man. I speak the truth.
       When Pistol lies, do this; and fig me, like 3530
       The bragging Spaniard.

     * Falstaff. What, is the old king dead?

     * Pistol. As nail in door. The things I speak are just.

     * Falstaff. Away, Bardolph! saddle my horse. Master Robert
       choose what office thou wilt in the land, 'tis thine. Pistol, 3535
       will double-charge thee with dignities.

     * Bardolph. O joyful day!
       I would not take a knighthood for my fortune. 3540

     * Pistol. What, I do bring good news?

     * Falstaff. Carry Master Silence to bed. Master Shallow, my Lord
       Shallow, be what thou wilt—I am Fortune's steward. Get on
       boots; we'll ride all night. O sweet Pistol! Away, Bardolph!
       [Exit BARDOLPH] Come, Pistol, utter more to me; and withal 3545
       devise something to do thyself good. Boot, boot, Master
       I know the young King is sick for me. Let us take any man's
       horses: the laws of England are at my commandment. Blessed
       they that have been my friends; and woe to my Lord Chief

     * Pistol. Let vultures vile seize on his lungs also!
       'Where is the life that late I led?' say they. 3555
       Why, here it is; welcome these pleasant days! Exeunt

   Act V, Scene 4

   London. A street
   _______________________________________________________________________

   Enter BEADLES, dragging in HOSTESS QUICKLY and DOLL TEARSHEET
     * Hostess Quickly. No, thou arrant knave; I would to God that I might
       die,
       that I might have thee hang'd. Thou hast drawn my shoulder out of
       joint. 3560

     * First Beadle. The constables have delivered her over to me; and she
       shall have whipping-cheer enough, I warrant her. There hath been
       a man or two lately kill'd about her.

     * Doll Tearsheet. Nut-hook, nut-hook, you lie. Come on; I'll tell
       thee what,
       thou damn'd tripe-visag'd rascal, an the child I now go with do
       3565
       miscarry, thou wert better thou hadst struck thy mother, thou
       paper-fac'd villain.

     * Hostess Quickly. O the Lord, that Sir John were come! He would make
       this a
       bloody day to somebody. But I pray God the fruit of her womb
       miscarry! 3570

     * First Beadle. If it do, you shall have a dozen of cushions again;
       you have but eleven now. Come, I charge you both go with me; for
       the man is dead that you and Pistol beat amongst you.

     * Doll Tearsheet. I'll tell you what, you thin man in a censer, I
       will have you
       as soundly swing'd for this—you blue-bottle rogue, you filthy 3575
       famish'd correctioner, if you be not swing'd, I'll forswear
       half-kirtles.

     * First Beadle. Come, come, you she knight-errant, come.

     * Hostess Quickly. O God, that right should thus overcome might!
       Well, of sufferance comes ease. 3580

     * Doll Tearsheet. Come, you rogue, come; bring me to a justice.

     * Hostess Quickly. Ay, come, you starv'd bloodhound.

     * Doll Tearsheet. Goodman death, goodman bones!

     * Hostess Quickly. Thou atomy, thou!

     * Doll Tearsheet. Come, you thin thing! come, you rascal! 3585

     * First Beadle. Very well. Exeunt

   Act V, Scene 5

   Westminster. Near the Abbey
   _______________________________________________________________________

   Enter GROOMS, strewing rushes
     * First Groom. More rushes, more rushes!

     * Second Groom. The trumpets have sounded twice.

     * Third Groom. 'Twill be two o'clock ere they come from the 3590
       coronation. Dispatch, dispatch. Exeunt

   Trumpets sound, and the KING and his train pass over the stage. After
   them enter FALSTAFF, SHALLOW, PISTOL, BARDOLPH, and page
     * Falstaff. Stand here by me, Master Robert Shallow; I will make the
       King do you grace. I will leer upon him, as 'a comes by; and do
       but mark the countenance that he will give me. 3595

     * Pistol. God bless thy lungs, good knight!

     * Falstaff. Come here, Pistol; stand behind me. [To SHALLOW] O, if
       I had had to have made new liveries, I would have bestowed the
       thousand pound I borrowed of you. But 'tis no matter; this poor
       show doth better; this doth infer the zeal I had to see him. 3600

     * Robert Shallow. It doth so.

     * Falstaff. It shows my earnestness of affection-

     * Robert Shallow. It doth so.

     * Falstaff. My devotion—

     * Robert Shallow. It doth, it doth, it doth. 3605

     * Falstaff. As it were, to ride day and night; and not to
       not to remember, not to have patience to shift me—

     * Robert Shallow. It is best, certain.

     * Falstaff. But to stand stained with travel, and sweating with 3610
       desire to see him; thinking of nothing else, putting all
       else in oblivion, as if there were nothing else to be done
       see him.

     * Pistol. 'Tis 'semper idem' for 'obsque hoc nihil est.' 'Tis all
       every part.

     * Robert Shallow. 'Tis so, indeed.

     * Pistol. My knight, I will inflame thy noble liver 3620
       And make thee rage.
       Thy Doll, and Helen of thy noble thoughts,
       Is in base durance and contagious prison;
       Hal'd thither
       By most mechanical and dirty hand. 3625
       Rouse up revenge from ebon den with fell Alecto's snake,
       For Doll is in. Pistol speaks nought but truth.

     * Falstaff. I will deliver her.

   [Shouts,within, and the trumpets sound]
     * Pistol. There roar'd the sea, and trumpet-clangor sounds. 3630

   Enter the KING and his train, the LORD CHIEF JUSTICE among them
     * Falstaff. God save thy Grace, King Hal; my royal Hal!

     * Pistol. The heavens thee guard and keep, most royal imp of

     * Falstaff. God save thee, my sweet boy! 3635

     * Henry V. My Lord Chief Justice, speak to that vain man.

     * Lord Chief Justice. Have you your wits? Know you what 'tis you

     * Falstaff. My king! my Jove! I speak to thee, my heart!

     * Henry V. I know thee not, old man. Fall to thy prayers. 3640
       How ill white hairs become a fool and jester!
       I have long dreamt of such a kind of man,
       So surfeit-swell'd, so old, and so profane;
       But being awak'd, I do despise my dream.
       Make less thy body hence, and more thy grace; 3645
       Leave gormandizing; know the grave doth gape
       For thee thrice wider than for other men—
       Reply not to me with a fool-born jest;
       Presume not that I am the thing I was,
       For God doth know, so shall the world perceive, 3650
       That I have turn'd away my former self;
       So will I those that kept me company.
       When thou dost hear I am as I have been,
       Approach me, and thou shalt be as thou wast,
       The tutor and the feeder of my riots. 3655
       Till then I banish thee, on pain of death,
       As I have done the rest of my misleaders,
       Not to come near our person by ten mile.
       For competence of life I will allow you,
       That lack of means enforce you not to evils; 3660
       And, as we hear you do reform yourselves,
       We will, according to your strengths and qualities,
       Give you advancement. Be it your charge, my lord,
       To see perform'd the tenour of our word.
       Set on. Exeunt the KING and his train 3665

     * Falstaff. Master Shallow, I owe you a thousand pounds.

     * Robert Shallow. Yea, marry, Sir John; which I beseech you to let me
       home with me.

     * Falstaff. That can hardly be, Master Shallow. Do not you grieve

       this; I shall be sent for in private to him. Look you, he
       seem thus to the world. Fear not your advancements; I will be
       man yet that shall make you great.

     * Robert Shallow. I cannot perceive how, unless you give me your
       and stuff me out with straw. I beseech you, good Sir John,
       have five hundred of my thousand.

     * Falstaff. Sir, I will be as good as my word. This that you
       was but a colour.

     * Robert Shallow. A colour that I fear you will die in, Sir John.
       3685

     * Falstaff. Fear no colours; go with me to dinner. Come,
       Pistol; come, Bardolph. I shall be sent for soon at night.

   Re-enter PRINCE JOHN, the LORD CHIEF JUSTICE, with officers
     * Lord Chief Justice. Go, carry Sir John Falstaff to the Fleet; 3690
       Take all his company along with him.

     * Falstaff. My lord, my lord—

     * Lord Chief Justice. I cannot now speak. I will hear you soon.
       Take them away.

     * Pistol. Si fortuna me tormenta, spero me contenta. 3695

   Exeunt all but PRINCE JOHN and the LORD CHIEF JUSTICE
     * Prince John. I like this fair proceeding of the King's.
       He hath intent his wonted followers
       Shall all be very well provided for;
       But all are banish'd till their conversations 3700
       Appear more wise and modest to the world.

     * Lord Chief Justice. And so they are.

     * Prince John. The King hath call'd his parliament, my lord.

     * Lord Chief Justice. He hath.

     * Prince John. I will lay odds that, ere this year expire, 3705
       We bear our civil swords and native fire
       As far as France. I heard a bird so sing,
       Whose music, to my thinking, pleas'd the King.
       Come, will you hence? Exeunt

   EPILOGUE.
     * Dancer. First my fear, then my curtsy, last my speech. My fear, is
       your
       displeasure; my curtsy, my duty; and my speech, to beg your
       pardons.
       If you look for a good speech now, you undo me; for what I have
       to say is of mine own making; and what, indeed, I should say will,
       I doubt,
       prove mine own marring. But to the purpose, and so to the 3715
       venture.
       Be it known to you, as it is very well, I was lately here in the
       end of a displeasing play, to pray your patience for it and to
       promise you a better. I meant, indeed, to pay you with this; which
       if like an 3720
       ill venture it come unluckily home, I break, and you, my gentle
       creditors, lose. Here I promis'd you I would be, and here I
       commit my body to your mercies. Bate me some, and I will pay you
       some,
       and, as most debtors do, promise you infinitely; and so I kneel
       down
       before you—but, indeed, to pray for the Queen. 3725
       If my tongue cannot entreat you to acquit me, will you command
       me to use my legs? And yet that were but light payment—to dance out
       of
       your debt. But a good conscience will make any possible
       satisfaction, and so would I. All the gentlewomen here have 3730
       forgiven me. If the gentlemen will not, then the gentlemen do not
       agree
       with the gentlewomen, which was never seen before in such an
       assembly.
       One word more, I beseech you. If you be not too much cloy'd
       with fat meat, our humble author will continue the story, with Sir
       John in 3735
       it, and make you merry with fair Katherine of France; where, for
       anything I know, Falstaff shall die of a sweat, unless already 'a
       be killed with your hard opinions; for Oldcastle died a martyr and
       this is not the man. My tongue is weary; when my legs are too, I
       will
       bid you good night. 3740
