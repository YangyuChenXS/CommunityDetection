                                SONNET CLIII

                  Cupid laid by his brand, and fell asleep:
                   A maid of Dian's this advantage found,
                And his love-kindling fire did quickly steep
                  In a cold valley-fountain of that ground;
                Which borrow'd from this holy fire of Love 5
                  A dateless lively heat, still to endure,
                And grew a seething bath, which yet men prove
                 Against strange maladies a sovereign cure.
               But at my mistress' eye Love's brand new-fired,
              The boy for trial needs would touch my breast; 10
                  I, sick withal, the help of bath desired,
                 And thither hied, a sad distemper'd guest,
                  But found no cure: the bath for my help lies
                 Where Cupid got new fire--my mistress' eyes. 14
