                                 SONNET XLVI

                   Mine eye and heart are at a mortal war
                  How to divide the conquest of thy sight;
              Mine eye my heart thy picture's sight would bar,
                My heart mine eye the freedom of that right.
              My heart doth plead that thou in him dost lie-- 5
                 A closet never pierced with crystal eyes--
                    But the defendant doth that plea deny
                  And says in him thy fair appearance lies.
                      To 'cide this title is impanneled
              A quest of thoughts, all tenants to the heart, 10
                     And by their verdict is determined
              The clear eye's moiety and the dear heart's part:
                  As thus; mine eye's due is thy outward part,
                And my heart's right thy inward love of heart. 14
