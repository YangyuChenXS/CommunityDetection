                                 SONNET XIII

                O, that you were yourself! but, love, you are
                No longer yours than you yourself here live:
                 Against this coming end you should prepare,
                And your sweet semblance to some other give.
               So should that beauty which you hold in lease 5
                    Find no determination: then you were
                  Yourself again after yourself's decease,
             When your sweet issue your sweet form should bear.
                   Who lets so fair a house fall to decay,
                  Which husbandry in honour might uphold 10
                  Against the stormy gusts of winter's day
                  And barren rage of death's eternal cold?
                  O, none but unthrifts! Dear my love, you know
                    You had a father: let your son say so. 14

                                      O
