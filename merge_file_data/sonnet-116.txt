                                 SONNET CXVI

                  Let me not to the marriage of true minds
                     Admit impediments. Love is not love
                   Which alters when it alteration finds,
                    Or bends with the remover to remove:
                      O no! it is an ever-fixed mark 5
                 That looks on tempests and is never shaken;
                   It is the star to every wandering bark,
            Whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken.
             Love's not Time's fool, though rosy lips and cheeks
                Within his bending sickle's compass come: 10
               Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks,
                 But bears it out even to the edge of doom.
                      If this be error and upon me proved,
                     I never writ, nor no man ever loved. 14
