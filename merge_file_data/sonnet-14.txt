                                 SONNET XIV

                 Not from the stars do I my judgment pluck;
                     And yet methinks I have astronomy,
                    But not to tell of good or evil luck,
                Of plagues, of dearths, or seasons' quality;
                 Nor can I fortune to brief minutes tell, 5
                Pointing to each his thunder, rain and wind,
                  Or say with princes if it shall go well,
                    By oft predict that I in heaven find:
                 But from thine eyes my knowledge I derive,
               And, constant stars, in them I read such art 10
                 As truth and beauty shall together thrive,
               If from thyself to store thou wouldst convert;
                      Or else of thee this I prognosticate:
                Thy end is truth's and beauty's doom and date. 14
