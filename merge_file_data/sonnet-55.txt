                                  SONNET LV

                    Not marble, nor the gilded monuments
               Of princes, shall outlive this powerful rhyme;
              But you shall shine more bright in these contents
              Than unswept stone besmear'd with sluttish time.
                 When wasteful war shall statues overturn, 5
                  And broils root out the work of masonry,
             Nor Mars his sword nor war's quick fire shall burn
                      The living record of your memory.
                   'Gainst death and all-oblivious enmity
         Shall you pace forth; your praise shall still find room 10
                      Even in the eyes of all posterity
                That wear this world out to the ending doom.
                   So, till the judgment that yourself arise,
                 You live in this, and dwell in lover's eyes. 14
