                                  SONNET VI

                  Then let not winter's ragged hand deface
                 In thee thy summer, ere thou be distill'd:
               Make sweet some vial; treasure thou some place
               With beauty's treasure, ere it be self-kill'd.
                     That use is not forbidden usury, 5
               Which happies those that pay the willing loan;
                  That's for thyself to breed another thee,
                  Or ten times happier, be it ten for one;
                Ten times thyself were happier than thou art,
                If ten of thine ten times refigured thee: 10
             Then what could death do, if thou shouldst depart,
                      Leaving thee living in posterity?
                 Be not self-will'd, for thou art much too fair
              To be death's conquest and make worms thine heir. 14
