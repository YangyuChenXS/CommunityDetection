                                 SONNET XXIV

              Mine eye hath play'd the painter and hath stell'd
                   Thy beauty's form in table of my heart;
                   My body is the frame wherein 'tis held,
                  And perspective it is the painter's art.
              For through the painter must you see his skill, 5
                To find where your true image pictured lies;
                 Which in my bosom's shop is hanging still,
                That hath his windows glazed with thine eyes.
              Now see what good turns eyes for eyes have done:
             Mine eyes have drawn thy shape, and thine for me 10
               Are windows to my breast, where-through the sun
                 Delights to peep, to gaze therein on thee;
                 Yet eyes this cunning want to grace their art;
               They draw but what they see, know not the heart. 14
