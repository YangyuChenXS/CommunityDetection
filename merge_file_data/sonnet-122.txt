                  Thy gift, thy tables, are within my brain
                    Full character'd with lasting memory,
                   Which shall above that idle rank remain
                     Beyond all date, even to eternity;
                Or at the least, so long as brain and heart 5
                     Have faculty by nature to subsist;
                 Till each to razed oblivion yield his part
                  Of thee, thy record never can be miss'd.
                 That poor retention could not so much hold,
                Nor need I tallies thy dear love to score; 10

                To trust those tables that receive thee more:
                       To keep an adjunct to remember thee
                     Were to import forgetfulness in me. 14
