                                SONNET CXLII

                  Love is my sin and thy dear virtue hate,
                 Hate of my sin, grounded on sinful loving:
               O, but with mine compare thou thine own state,
                And thou shalt find it merits not reproving;
                Or, if it do, not from those lips of thine, 5
                 That have profaned their scarlet ornaments
               And seal'd false bonds of love as oft as mine,
                Robb'd others' beds' revenues of their rents.
               Be it lawful I love thee, as thou lovest those
               Whom thine eyes woo as mine importune thee: 10
                 Root pity in thy heart, that when it grows
                     Thy pity may deserve to pitied be.
                 If thou dost seek to have what thou dost hide,
                    By self-example mayst thou be denied! 14

                                      O
