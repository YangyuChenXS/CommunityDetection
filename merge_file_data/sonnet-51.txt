                  Thus can my love excuse the slow offence
                  Of my dull bearer when from thee I speed:
              From where thou art why should I haste me thence?
                    Till I return, of posting is no need.
               O, what excuse will my poor beast then find, 5
                   When swift extremity can seem but slow?
               Then should I spur, though mounted on the wind;
                   In winged speed no motion shall I know:
                 Then can no horse with my desire keep pace;
             Therefore desire of perfect'st love being made, 10
               Shall neigh--no dull flesh--in his fiery race;
               But love, for love, thus shall excuse my jade;
                   Since from thee going he went wilful-slow,
               Towards thee I'll run, and give him leave to go. 14

                                      O
