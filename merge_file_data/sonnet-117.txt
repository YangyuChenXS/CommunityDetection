                                SONNET CXVII

                   Accuse me thus: that I have scanted all
                 Wherein I should your great deserts repay,
                   Forgot upon your dearest love to call,
                   Whereto all bonds do tie me day by day;
               That I have frequent been with unknown minds 5
               And given to time your own dear-purchased right
                  That I have hoisted sail to all the winds
             Which should transport me farthest from your sight.
                   Book both my wilfulness and errors down
                  And on just proof surmise accumulate; 10
                  Bring me within the level of your frown,
                  But shoot not at me in your waken'd hate;
                   Since my appeal says I did strive to prove
                    The constancy and virtue of your love. 14
