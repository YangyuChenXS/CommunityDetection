                  Those lips that Love's own hand did make
                 Breathed forth the sound that said 'I hate'
                     To me that languish'd for her sake;
                      But when she saw my woeful state,
                   Straight in her heart did mercy come, 5
                     Chiding that tongue that ever sweet
                       Was used in giving gentle doom,
                      And taught it thus anew to greet:
                      'I hate' she alter'd with an end,
                      That follow'd it as gentle day 10
                     Doth follow night, who like a fiend
                     From heaven to hell is flown away;
                       'I hate' from hate away she threw,
                     And saved my life, saying 'not you.' 14
