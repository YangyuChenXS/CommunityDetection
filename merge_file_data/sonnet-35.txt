                                 SONNET XXXV

              No more be grieved at that which thou hast done:
                Roses have thorns, and silver fountains mud;
                Clouds and eclipses stain both moon and sun,
                 And loathsome canker lives in sweetest bud.
                 All men make faults, and even I in this, 5
                   Authorizing thy trespass with compare,
                    Myself corrupting, salving thy amiss,
                  Excusing thy sins more than thy sins are;
                 For to thy sensual fault I bring in sense--
                   Thy adverse party is thy advocate-- 10
                 And 'gainst myself a lawful plea commence:
                    Such civil war is in my love and hate
                        That I an accessary needs must be
                To that sweet thief which sourly robs from me. 14
