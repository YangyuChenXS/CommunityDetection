                                 SONNET VII

                  Lo! in the orient when the gracious light
                  Lifts up his burning head, each under eye
                   Doth homage to his new-appearing sight,
                   Serving with looks his sacred majesty;
              And having climb'd the steep-up heavenly hill, 5
                 Resembling strong youth in his middle age,
                  yet mortal looks adore his beauty still,
                     Attending on his golden pilgrimage;
                But when from highmost pitch, with weary car,
                Like feeble age, he reeleth from the day, 10
                 The eyes, 'fore duteous, now converted are
                  From his low tract and look another way:
                     So thou, thyself out-going in thy noon,
                  Unlook'd on diest, unless thou get a son. 14
