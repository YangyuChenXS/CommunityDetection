                    No longer mourn for me when I am dead
                  Then you shall hear the surly sullen bell
                  Give warning to the world that I am fled
              From this vile world, with vilest worms to dwell:
                 Nay, if you read this line, remember not 5
                  The hand that writ it; for I love you so
                That I in your sweet thoughts would be forgot
                 If thinking on me then should make you woe.
                   O, if, I say, you look upon this verse
                 When I perhaps compounded am with clay, 10
                  Do not so much as my poor name rehearse.
                 But let your love even with my life decay,
                 Lest the wise world should look into your moan
                    And mock you with me after I am gone. 14

                                      O
