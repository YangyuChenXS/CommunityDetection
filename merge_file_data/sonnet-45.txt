                                 SONNET XLV

                 The other two, slight air and purging fire,
                    Are both with thee, wherever I abide;
                 The first my thought, the other my desire,
                These present-absent with swift motion slide.
                 For when these quicker elements are gone 5
                     In tender embassy of love to thee,
                 My life, being made of four, with two alone
               Sinks down to death, oppress'd with melancholy;
                     Until life's composition be recured
              By those swift messengers return'd from thee, 10
                  Who even but now come back again, assured
                  Of thy fair health, recounting it to me:
                   This told, I joy; but then no longer glad,
                I send them back again and straight grow sad. 14
