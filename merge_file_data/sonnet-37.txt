                                SONNET XXXVII

                     As a decrepit father takes delight
                 To see his active child do deeds of youth,
                 So I, made lame by fortune's dearest spite,
                 Take all my comfort of thy worth and truth.
               For whether beauty, birth, or wealth, or wit, 5
                    Or any of these all, or all, or more,
                    Entitled in thy parts do crowned sit,
                   I make my love engrafted to this store:
                 So then I am not lame, poor, nor despised,
             Whilst that this shadow doth such substance give 10
                     That I in thy abundance am sufficed
                    And by a part of all thy glory live.
                  Look, what is best, that best I wish in thee:
                  This wish I have; then ten times happy me! 14
