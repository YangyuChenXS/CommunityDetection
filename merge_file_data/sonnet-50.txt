                     How heavy do I journey on the way,
                  When what I seek, my weary travel's end,
                 Doth teach that ease and that repose to say
             'Thus far the miles are measured from thy friend!'
                The beast that bears me, tired with my woe, 5
                 Plods dully on, to bear that weight in me,
                 As if by some instinct the wretch did know
              His rider loved not speed, being made from thee:
                    The bloody spur cannot provoke him on
               That sometimes anger thrusts into his hide; 10
                   Which heavily he answers with a groan,
                 More sharp to me than spurring to his side;
                  For that same groan doth put this in my mind;
                   My grief lies onward and my joy behind. 14
