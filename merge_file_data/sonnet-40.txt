               Take all my loves, my love, yea, take them all;
              What hast thou then more than thou hadst before?
              No love, my love, that thou mayst true love call;
               All mine was thine before thou hadst this more.
                Then if for my love thou my love receivest, 5
                 I cannot blame thee for my love thou usest;
                But yet be blamed, if thou thyself deceivest
                  By wilful taste of what thyself refusest.
                   I do forgive thy robbery, gentle thief,
                 Although thou steal thee all my poverty; 10
                 And yet, love knows, it is a greater grief
               To bear love's wrong than hate's known injury.
                  Lascivious grace, in whom all ill well shows,
                Kill me with spites; yet we must not be foes. 14
