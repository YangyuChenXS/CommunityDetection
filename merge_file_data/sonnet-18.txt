                                SONNET XVIII

                   Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?
                  Thou art more lovely and more temperate:
                Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
                And summer's lease hath all too short a date:
                Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines, 5
                  And often is his gold complexion dimm'd;
                 And every fair from fair sometime declines,
              By chance or nature's changing course untrimm'd;
                    But thy eternal summer shall not fade
               Nor lose possession of that fair thou owest; 10
              Nor shall Death brag thou wander'st in his shade,
                 When in eternal lines to time thou growest:
                   So long as men can breathe or eyes can see,
               So long lives this and this gives life to thee. 14
