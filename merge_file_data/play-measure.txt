   Act I, Scene 1

   An apartment in the DUKE’S palace.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   [Enter DUKE VINCENTIO, ESCALUS, Lords and] [p]Attendants]
     * Vincentio. Escalus.

     * Escalus. My lord.

     * Vincentio. Of government the properties to unfold, 5
       Would seem in me to affect speech and discourse;
       Since I am put to know that your own science
       Exceeds, in that, the lists of all advice
       My strength can give you: then no more remains,
       But that to your sufficiency [—] 10
       [—] as your Worth is able,]
       And let them work. The nature of our people,
       Our city's institutions, and the terms
       For common justice, you're as pregnant in
       As art and practise hath enriched any 15
       That we remember. There is our commission,
       From which we would not have you warp. Call hither,
       I say, bid come before us Angelo.
       [Exit an Attendant]
       What figure of us Think you he will bear? 20
       For you must know, we have with special soul
       Elected him our absence to supply,
       Lent him our terror, dress'd him with our love,
       And given his deputation all the organs
       Of our own power: what think you of it? 25

     * Escalus. If any in Vienna be of worth
       To undergo such ample grace and honour,
       It is Lord Angelo.

     * Vincentio. Look where he comes.

   [Enter ANGELO]
     * Angelo. Always obedient to your grace's will,
       I come to know your pleasure.

     * Vincentio. Angelo,
       There is a kind of character in thy life,
       That to the observer doth thy history 35
       Fully unfold. Thyself and thy belongings
       Are not thine own so proper as to waste
       Thyself upon thy virtues, they on thee.
       Heaven doth with us as we with torches do,
       Not light them for themselves; for if our virtues 40
       Did not go forth of us, 'twere all alike
       As if we had them not. Spirits are not finely touch'd
       But to fine issues, nor Nature never lends
       The smallest scruple of her excellence
       But, like a thrifty goddess, she determines 45
       Herself the glory of a creditor,
       Both thanks and use. But I do bend my speech
       To one that can my part in him advertise;
       Hold therefore, Angelo:—
       In our remove be thou at full ourself; 50
       Mortality and mercy in Vienna
       Live in thy tongue and heart: old Escalus,
       Though first in question, is thy secondary.
       Take thy commission.

     * Angelo. Now, good my lord, 55
       Let there be some more test made of my metal,
       Before so noble and so great a figure
       Be stamp'd upon it.

     * Vincentio. No more evasion:
       We have with a leaven'd and prepared choice 60
       Proceeded to you; therefore take your honours.
       Our haste from hence is of so quick condition
       That it prefers itself and leaves unquestion'd
       Matters of needful value. We shall write to you,
       As time and our concernings shall importune, 65
       How it goes with us, and do look to know
       What doth befall you here. So, fare you well;
       To the hopeful execution do I leave you
       Of your commissions.

     * Angelo. Yet give leave, my lord, 70
       That we may bring you something on the way.

     * Vincentio. My haste may not admit it;
       Nor need you, on mine honour, have to do
       With any scruple; your scope is as mine own
       So to enforce or qualify the laws 75
       As to your soul seems good. Give me your hand:
       I'll privily away. I love the people,
       But do not like to stage me to their eyes:
       Through it do well, I do not relish well
       Their loud applause and Aves vehement; 80
       Nor do I think the man of safe discretion
       That does affect it. Once more, fare you well.

     * Angelo. The heavens give safety to your purposes!

     * Escalus. Lead forth and bring you back in happiness!

     * Vincentio. I thank you. Fare you well. 85

   [Exit]
     * Escalus. I shall desire you, sir, to give me leave
       To have free speech with you; and it concerns me
       To look into the bottom of my place:
       A power I have, but of what strength and nature 90
       I am not yet instructed.

     * Angelo. 'Tis so with me. Let us withdraw together,
       And we may soon our satisfaction have
       Touching that point.

     * Escalus. I'll wait upon your honour. 95

   [Exeunt]

   Act I, Scene 2

   A Street.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   [Enter LUCIO and two Gentlemen]
     * Lucio. If the duke with the other dukes come not to
       composition with the King of Hungary, why then all
       the dukes fall upon the king. 100

     * First Gentleman. Heaven grant us its peace, but not the King of
       Hungary's!

     * Second Gentleman. Amen.

     * Lucio. Thou concludest like the sanctimonious pirate, that
       went to sea with the Ten Commandments, but scraped 105
       one out of the table.

     * Second Gentleman. 'Thou shalt not steal'?

     * Lucio. Ay, that he razed.

     * First Gentleman. Why, 'twas a commandment to command the captain
       and
       all the rest from their functions: they put forth 110
       to steal. There's not a soldier of us all, that, in
       the thanksgiving before meat, do relish the petition
       well that prays for peace.

     * Second Gentleman. I never heard any soldier dislike it.

     * Lucio. I believe thee; for I think thou never wast where 115
       grace was said.

     * Second Gentleman. No? a dozen times at least.

     * First Gentleman. What, in metre?

     * Lucio. In any proportion or in any language.

     * First Gentleman. I think, or in any religion. 120

     * Lucio. Ay, why not? Grace is grace, despite of all
       controversy: as, for example, thou thyself art a
       wicked villain, despite of all grace.

     * First Gentleman. Well, there went but a pair of shears between us.

     * Lucio. I grant; as there may between the lists and the 125
       velvet. Thou art the list.

     * First Gentleman. And thou the velvet: thou art good velvet; thou'rt
       a three-piled piece, I warrant thee: I had as lief
       be a list of an English kersey as be piled, as thou
       art piled, for a French velvet. Do I speak 130
       feelingly now?

     * Lucio. I think thou dost; and, indeed, with most painful
       feeling of thy speech: I will, out of thine own
       confession, learn to begin thy health; but, whilst I
       live, forget to drink after thee. 135

     * First Gentleman. I think I have done myself wrong, have I not?

     * Second Gentleman. Yes, that thou hast, whether thou art tainted or
       free.

     * Lucio. Behold, behold. where Madam Mitigation comes! I
       have purchased as many diseases under her roof as come to—

     * Second Gentleman. To what, I pray? 140

     * Lucio. Judge.

     * Second Gentleman. To three thousand dolours a year.

     * First Gentleman. Ay, and more.

     * Lucio. A French crown more.

     * First Gentleman. Thou art always figuring diseases in me; but thou
       145
       art full of error; I am sound.

     * Lucio. Nay, not as one would say, healthy; but so sound as
       things that are hollow: thy bones are hollow;
       impiety has made a feast of thee.

   [Enter MISTRESS OVERDONE]
     * First Gentleman. How now! which of your hips has the most profound
       sciatica?

     * Mistress Overdone. Well, well; there's one yonder arrested and
       carried
       to prison was worth five thousand of you all.

     * Second Gentleman. Who's that, I pray thee?

     * Mistress Overdone. Marry, sir, that's Claudio, Signior Claudio. 155

     * First Gentleman. Claudio to prison? 'tis not so.

     * Mistress Overdone. Nay, but I know 'tis so: I saw him arrested, saw
       him carried away; and, which is more, within these
       three days his head to be chopped off.

     * Lucio. But, after all this fooling, I would not have it so. 160
       Art thou sure of this?

     * Mistress Overdone. I am too sure of it: and it is for getting Madam
       Julietta with child.

     * Lucio. Believe me, this may be: he promised to meet me two
       hours since, and he was ever precise in 165
       promise-keeping.

     * Second Gentleman. Besides, you know, it draws something near to the
       speech we had to such a purpose.

     * First Gentleman. But, most of all, agreeing with the proclamation.

     * Lucio. Away! let's go learn the truth of it. 170

   [Exeunt LUCIO and Gentlemen]
     * Mistress Overdone. Thus, what with the war, what with the sweat,
       what
       with the gallows and what with poverty, I am
       custom-shrunk.
       [Enter POMPEY] 175
       How now! what's the news with you?

     * Pompey. Yonder man is carried to prison.

     * Mistress Overdone. Well; what has he done?

     * Pompey. A woman.

     * Mistress Overdone. But what's his offence? 180

     * Pompey. Groping for trouts in a peculiar river.

     * Mistress Overdone. What, is there a maid with child by him?

     * Pompey. No, but there's a woman with maid by him. You have
       not heard of the proclamation, have you?

     * Mistress Overdone. What proclamation, man? 185

     * Pompey. All houses in the suburbs of Vienna must be plucked down.

     * Mistress Overdone. And what shall become of those in the city?

     * Pompey. They shall stand for seed: they had gone down too,
       but that a wise burgher put in for them.

     * Mistress Overdone. But shall all our houses of resort in the
       suburbs be 190
       pulled down?

     * Pompey. To the ground, mistress.

     * Mistress Overdone. Why, here's a change indeed in the commonwealth!
       What shall become of me?

     * Pompey. Come; fear you not: good counsellors lack no 195
       clients: though you change your place, you need not
       change your trade; I'll be your tapster still.
       Courage! there will be pity taken on you: you that
       have worn your eyes almost out in the service, you
       will be considered. 200

     * Mistress Overdone. What's to do here, Thomas tapster? let's
       withdraw.

     * Pompey. Here comes Signior Claudio, led by the provost to
       prison; and there's Madam Juliet.

   [Exeunt]

   [Enter Provost, CLAUDIO, JULIET, and Officers]
     * Claudio. Fellow, why dost thou show me thus to the world?
       Bear me to prison, where I am committed.

     * Provost. I do it not in evil disposition,
       But from Lord Angelo by special charge.

     * Claudio. Thus can the demigod Authority 210
       Make us pay down for our offence by weight
       The words of heaven; on whom it will, it will;
       On whom it will not, so; yet still 'tis just.

   [Re-enter LUCIO and two Gentlemen]
     * Lucio. Why, how now, Claudio! whence comes this restraint? 215

     * Claudio. From too much liberty, my Lucio, liberty:
       As surfeit is the father of much fast,
       So every scope by the immoderate use
       Turns to restraint. Our natures do pursue,
       Like rats that ravin down their proper bane, 220
       A thirsty evil; and when we drink we die.

     * Lucio. If could speak so wisely under an arrest, I would
       send for certain of my creditors: and yet, to say
       the truth, I had as lief have the foppery of freedom
       as the morality of imprisonment. What's thy 225
       offence, Claudio?

     * Claudio. What but to speak of would offend again.

     * Lucio. What, is't murder?

     * Claudio. No.

     * Lucio. Lechery? 230

     * Claudio. Call it so.

     * Provost. Away, sir! you must go.

     * Claudio. One word, good friend. Lucio, a word with you.

     * Lucio. A hundred, if they'll do you any good.
       Is lechery so look'd after? 235

     * Claudio. Thus stands it with me: upon a true contract
       I got possession of Julietta's bed:
       You know the lady; she is fast my wife,
       Save that we do the denunciation lack
       Of outward order: this we came not to, 240
       Only for propagation of a dower
       Remaining in the coffer of her friends,
       From whom we thought it meet to hide our love
       Till time had made them for us. But it chances
       The stealth of our most mutual entertainment 245
       With character too gross is writ on Juliet.

     * Lucio. With child, perhaps?

     * Claudio. Unhappily, even so.
       And the new deputy now for the duke—
       Whether it be the fault and glimpse of newness, 250
       Or whether that the body public be
       A horse whereon the governor doth ride,
       Who, newly in the seat, that it may know
       He can command, lets it straight feel the spur;
       Whether the tyranny be in his place, 255
       Or in his emmence that fills it up,
       I stagger in:—but this new governor
       Awakes me all the enrolled penalties
       Which have, like unscour'd armour, hung by the wall
       So long that nineteen zodiacs have gone round 260
       And none of them been worn; and, for a name,
       Now puts the drowsy and neglected act
       Freshly on me: 'tis surely for a name.

     * Lucio. I warrant it is: and thy head stands so tickle on
       thy shoulders that a milkmaid, if she be in love, 265
       may sigh it off. Send after the duke and appeal to
       him.

     * Claudio. I have done so, but he's not to be found.
       I prithee, Lucio, do me this kind service:
       This day my sister should the cloister enter 270
       And there receive her approbation:
       Acquaint her with the danger of my state:
       Implore her, in my voice, that she make friends
       To the strict deputy; bid herself assay him:
       I have great hope in that; for in her youth 275
       There is a prone and speechless dialect,
       Such as move men; beside, she hath prosperous art
       When she will play with reason and discourse,
       And well she can persuade.

     * Lucio. I pray she may; as well for the encouragement of the 280
       like, which else would stand under grievous
       imposition, as for the enjoying of thy life, who I
       would be sorry should be thus foolishly lost at a
       game of tick-tack. I'll to her.

     * Claudio. I thank you, good friend Lucio. 285

     * Lucio. Within two hours.

     * Claudio. Come, officer, away!

   [Exeunt]

   Act I, Scene 3

   A monastery.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   [Enter DUKE VINCENTIO and FRIAR THOMAS]
     * Vincentio. No, holy father; throw away that thought; 290
       Believe not that the dribbling dart of love
       Can pierce a complete bosom. Why I desire thee
       To give me secret harbour, hath a purpose
       More grave and wrinkled than the aims and ends
       Of burning youth. 295

     * Friar Thomas. May your grace speak of it?

     * Vincentio. My holy sir, none better knows than you
       How I have ever loved the life removed
       And held in idle price to haunt assemblies
       Where youth, and cost, and witless bravery keeps. 300
       I have deliver'd to Lord Angelo,
       A man of stricture and firm abstinence,
       My absolute power and place here in Vienna,
       And he supposes me travell'd to Poland;
       For so I have strew'd it in the common ear, 305
       And so it is received. Now, pious sir,
       You will demand of me why I do this?

     * Friar Thomas. Gladly, my lord.

     * Vincentio. We have strict statutes and most biting laws.
       The needful bits and curbs to headstrong weeds, 310
       Which for this nineteen years we have let slip;
       Even like an o'ergrown lion in a cave,
       That goes not out to prey. Now, as fond fathers,
       Having bound up the threatening twigs of birch,
       Only to stick it in their children's sight 315
       For terror, not to use, in time the rod
       Becomes more mock'd than fear'd; so our decrees,
       Dead to infliction, to themselves are dead;
       And liberty plucks justice by the nose;
       The baby beats the nurse, and quite athwart 320
       Goes all decorum.

     * Friar Thomas. It rested in your grace
       To unloose this tied-up justice when you pleased:
       And it in you more dreadful would have seem'd
       Than in Lord Angelo. 325

     * Vincentio. I do fear, too dreadful:
       Sith 'twas my fault to give the people scope,
       'Twould be my tyranny to strike and gall them
       For what I bid them do: for we bid this be done,
       When evil deeds have their permissive pass 330
       And not the punishment. Therefore indeed, my father,
       I have on Angelo imposed the office;
       Who may, in the ambush of my name, strike home,
       And yet my nature never in the fight
       To do in slander. And to behold his sway, 335
       I will, as 'twere a brother of your order,
       Visit both prince and people: therefore, I prithee,
       Supply me with the habit and instruct me
       How I may formally in person bear me
       Like a true friar. More reasons for this action 340
       At our more leisure shall I render you;
       Only, this one: Lord Angelo is precise;
       Stands at a guard with envy; scarce confesses
       That his blood flows, or that his appetite
       Is more to bread than stone: hence shall we see, 345
       If power change purpose, what our seemers be.

   [Exeunt]

   Act I, Scene 4

   A nunnery.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   [Enter ISABELLA and FRANCISCA]
     * Isabella. And have you nuns no farther privileges?

     * Francisca. Are not these large enough? 350

     * Isabella. Yes, truly; I speak not as desiring more;
       But rather wishing a more strict restraint
       Upon the sisterhood, the votarists of Saint Clare.

     * Lucio. [Within] Ho! Peace be in this place!

     * Isabella. Who's that which calls? 355

     * Francisca. It is a man's voice. Gentle Isabella,
       Turn you the key, and know his business of him;
       You may, I may not; you are yet unsworn.
       When you have vow'd, you must not speak with men
       But in the presence of the prioress: 360
       Then, if you speak, you must not show your face,
       Or, if you show your face, you must not speak.
       He calls again; I pray you, answer him.

   [Exit]
     * Isabella. Peace and prosperity! Who is't that calls 365

   [Enter LUCIO]
     * Lucio. Hail, virgin, if you be, as those cheek-roses
       Proclaim you are no less! Can you so stead me
       As bring me to the sight of Isabella,
       A novice of this place and the fair sister 370
       To her unhappy brother Claudio?

     * Isabella. Why 'her unhappy brother'? let me ask,
       The rather for I now must make you know
       I am that Isabella and his sister.

     * Lucio. Gentle and fair, your brother kindly greets you: 375
       Not to be weary with you, he's in prison.

     * Isabella. Woe me! for what?

     * Lucio. For that which, if myself might be his judge,
       He should receive his punishment in thanks:
       He hath got his friend with child. 380

     * Isabella. Sir, make me not your story.

     * Lucio. It is true.
       I would not—though 'tis my familiar sin
       With maids to seem the lapwing and to jest,
       Tongue far from heart—play with all virgins so: 385
       I hold you as a thing ensky'd and sainted.
       By your renouncement an immortal spirit,
       And to be talk'd with in sincerity,
       As with a saint.

     * Isabella. You do blaspheme the good in mocking me. 390

     * Lucio. Do not believe it. Fewness and truth, 'tis thus:
       Your brother and his lover have embraced:
       As those that feed grow full, as blossoming time
       That from the seedness the bare fallow brings
       To teeming foison, even so her plenteous womb 395
       Expresseth his full tilth and husbandry.

     * Isabella. Some one with child by him? My cousin Juliet?

     * Lucio. Is she your cousin?

     * Isabella. Adoptedly; as school-maids change their names
       By vain though apt affection. 400

     * Lucio. She it is.

     * Isabella. O, let him marry her.

     * Lucio. This is the point.
       The duke is very strangely gone from hence;
       Bore many gentlemen, myself being one, 405
       In hand and hope of action: but we do learn
       By those that know the very nerves of state,
       His givings-out were of an infinite distance
       From his true-meant design. Upon his place,
       And with full line of his authority, 410
       Governs Lord Angelo; a man whose blood
       Is very snow-broth; one who never feels
       The wanton stings and motions of the sense,
       But doth rebate and blunt his natural edge
       With profits of the mind, study and fast. 415
       He—to give fear to use and liberty,
       Which have for long run by the hideous law,
       As mice by lions—hath pick'd out an act,
       Under whose heavy sense your brother's life
       Falls into forfeit: he arrests him on it; 420
       And follows close the rigour of the statute,
       To make him an example. All hope is gone,
       Unless you have the grace by your fair prayer
       To soften Angelo: and that's my pith of business
       'Twixt you and your poor brother. 425

     * Isabella. Doth he so seek his life?

     * Lucio. Has censured him
       Already; and, as I hear, the provost hath
       A warrant for his execution.

     * Isabella. Alas! what poor ability's in me 430
       To do him good?

     * Lucio. Assay the power you have.

     * Isabella. My power? Alas, I doubt—

     * Lucio. Our doubts are traitors
       And make us lose the good we oft might win 435
       By fearing to attempt. Go to Lord Angelo,
       And let him learn to know, when maidens sue,
       Men give like gods; but when they weep and kneel,
       All their petitions are as freely theirs
       As they themselves would owe them. 440

     * Isabella. I'll see what I can do.

     * Lucio. But speedily.

     * Isabella. I will about it straight;
       No longer staying but to give the mother
       Notice of my affair. I humbly thank you: 445
       Commend me to my brother: soon at night
       I'll send him certain word of my success.

     * Lucio. I take my leave of you.

     * Isabella. Good sir, adieu.

   Act II, Scene 1

   A hall In ANGELO’s house.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   [Enter ANGELO, ESCALUS, and a Justice, Provost,] [p]Officers, and other
   Attendants, behind]
     * Angelo. We must not make a scarecrow of the law,
       Setting it up to fear the birds of prey,
       And let it keep one shape, till custom make it 455
       Their perch and not their terror.

     * Escalus. Ay, but yet
       Let us be keen, and rather cut a little,
       Than fall, and bruise to death. Alas, this gentleman
       Whom I would save, had a most noble father! 460
       Let but your honour know,
       Whom I believe to be most strait in virtue,
       That, in the working of your own affections,
       Had time cohered with place or place with wishing,
       Or that the resolute acting of your blood 465
       Could have attain'd the effect of your own purpose,
       Whether you had not sometime in your life
       Err'd in this point which now you censure him,
       And pull'd the law upon you.

     * Angelo. 'Tis one thing to be tempted, Escalus, 470
       Another thing to fall. I not deny,
       The jury, passing on the prisoner's life,
       May in the sworn twelve have a thief or two
       Guiltier than him they try. What's open made to justice,
       That justice seizes: what know the laws 475
       That thieves do pass on thieves? 'Tis very pregnant,
       The jewel that we find, we stoop and take't
       Because we see it; but what we do not see
       We tread upon, and never think of it.
       You may not so extenuate his offence 480
       For I have had such faults; but rather tell me,
       When I, that censure him, do so offend,
       Let mine own judgment pattern out my death,
       And nothing come in partial. Sir, he must die.

     * Escalus. Be it as your wisdom will. 485

     * Angelo. Where is the provost?

     * Provost. Here, if it like your honour.

     * Angelo. See that Claudio
       Be executed by nine to-morrow morning:
       Bring him his confessor, let him be prepared; 490
       For that's the utmost of his pilgrimage.

   [Exit Provost]
     * Escalus. [Aside] Well, heaven forgive him! and forgive us all!
       Some rise by sin, and some by virtue fall:
       Some run from brakes of ice, and answer none: 495
       And some condemned for a fault alone.

   [Enter ELBOW, and Officers with FROTH and POMPEY]
     * Elbow. Come, bring them away: if these be good people in
       a commonweal that do nothing but use their abuses in
       common houses, I know no law: bring them away. 500

     * Angelo. How now, sir! What's your name? and what's the matter?

     * Elbow. If it Please your honour, I am the poor duke's
       constable, and my name is Elbow: I do lean upon
       justice, sir, and do bring in here before your good
       honour two notorious benefactors. 505

     * Angelo. Benefactors? Well; what benefactors are they? are
       they not malefactors?

     * Elbow. If it? please your honour, I know not well what they
       are: but precise villains they are, that I am sure
       of; and void of all profanation in the world that 510
       good Christians ought to have.

     * Escalus. This comes off well; here's a wise officer.

     * Angelo. Go to: what quality are they of? Elbow is your
       name? why dost thou not speak, Elbow?

     * Pompey. He cannot, sir; he's out at elbow. 515

     * Angelo. What are you, sir?

     * Elbow. He, sir! a tapster, sir; parcel-bawd; one that
       serves a bad woman; whose house, sir, was, as they
       say, plucked down in the suburbs; and now she
       professes a hot-house, which, I think, is a very ill house too. 520

     * Escalus. How know you that?

     * Elbow. My wife, sir, whom I detest before heaven and your honour,—

     * Escalus. How? thy wife?

     * Elbow. Ay, sir; whom, I thank heaven, is an honest woman,—

     * Escalus. Dost thou detest her therefore? 525

     * Elbow. I say, sir, I will detest myself also, as well as
       she, that this house, if it be not a bawd's house,
       it is pity of her life, for it is a naughty house.

     * Escalus. How dost thou know that, constable?

     * Elbow. Marry, sir, by my wife; who, if she had been a woman 530
       cardinally given, might have been accused in
       fornication, adultery, and all uncleanliness there.

     * Escalus. By the woman's means?

     * Elbow. Ay, sir, by Mistress Overdone's means: but as she
       spit in his face, so she defied him. 535

     * Pompey. Sir, if it please your honour, this is not so.

     * Elbow. Prove it before these varlets here, thou honourable
       man; prove it.

     * Escalus. Do you hear how he misplaces?

     * Pompey. Sir, she came in great with child; and longing, 540
       saving your honour's reverence, for stewed prunes;
       sir, we had but two in the house, which at that very
       distant time stood, as it were, in a fruit-dish, a
       dish of some three-pence; your honours have seen
       such dishes; they are not China dishes, but very 545
       good dishes,—

     * Escalus. Go to, go to: no matter for the dish, sir.

     * Pompey. No, indeed, sir, not of a pin; you are therein in
       the right: but to the point. As I say, this
       Mistress Elbow, being, as I say, with child, and 550
       being great-bellied, and longing, as I said, for
       prunes; and having but two in the dish, as I said,
       Master Froth here, this very man, having eaten the
       rest, as I said, and, as I say, paying for them very
       honestly; for, as you know, Master Froth, I could 555
       not give you three-pence again.

     * Froth. No, indeed.

     * Pompey. Very well: you being then, if you be remembered,
       cracking the stones of the foresaid prunes,—

     * Froth. Ay, so I did indeed. 560

     * Pompey. Why, very well; I telling you then, if you be
       remembered, that such a one and such a one were past
       cure of the thing you wot of, unless they kept very
       good diet, as I told you,—

     * Froth. All this is true. 565

     * Pompey. Why, very well, then,—

     * Escalus. Come, you are a tedious fool: to the purpose. What
       was done to Elbow's wife, that he hath cause to
       complain of? Come me to what was done to her.

     * Pompey. Sir, your honour cannot come to that yet. 570

     * Escalus. No, sir, nor I mean it not.

     * Pompey. Sir, but you shall come to it, by your honour's
       leave. And, I beseech you, look into Master Froth
       here, sir; a man of four-score pound a year; whose
       father died at Hallowmas: was't not at Hallowmas, 575
       Master Froth?

     * Froth. All-hallond eve.

     * Pompey. Why, very well; I hope here be truths. He, sir,
       sitting, as I say, in a lower chair, sir; 'twas in
       the Bunch of Grapes, where indeed you have a delight 580
       to sit, have you not?

     * Froth. I have so; because it is an open room and good for winter.

     * Pompey. Why, very well, then; I hope here be truths.

     * Angelo. This will last out a night in Russia,
       When nights are longest there: I'll take my leave. 585
       And leave you to the hearing of the cause;
       Hoping you'll find good cause to whip them all.

     * Escalus. I think no less. Good morrow to your lordship.
       [Exit ANGELO]
       Now, sir, come on: what was done to Elbow's wife, once more? 590

     * Pompey. Once, sir? there was nothing done to her once.

     * Elbow. I beseech you, sir, ask him what this man did to my wife.

     * Pompey. I beseech your honour, ask me.

     * Escalus. Well, sir; what did this gentleman to her?

     * Pompey. I beseech you, sir, look in this gentleman's face. 595
       Good Master Froth, look upon his honour; 'tis for a
       good purpose. Doth your honour mark his face?

     * Escalus. Ay, sir, very well.

     * Pompey. Nay; I beseech you, mark it well.

     * Escalus. Well, I do so. 600

     * Pompey. Doth your honour see any harm in his face?

     * Escalus. Why, no.

     * Pompey. I'll be supposed upon a book, his face is the worst
       thing about him. Good, then; if his face be the
       worst thing about him, how could Master Froth do the 605
       constable's wife any harm? I would know that of
       your honour.

     * Escalus. He's in the right. Constable, what say you to it?

     * Elbow. First, an it like you, the house is a respected
       house; next, this is a respected fellow; and his 610
       mistress is a respected woman.

     * Pompey. By this hand, sir, his wife is a more respected
       person than any of us all.

     * Elbow. Varlet, thou liest; thou liest, wicked varlet! the
       time has yet to come that she was ever respected 615
       with man, woman, or child.

     * Pompey. Sir, she was respected with him before he married with her.

     * Escalus. Which is the wiser here? Justice or Iniquity? Is
       this true?

     * Elbow. O thou caitiff! O thou varlet! O thou wicked 620
       Hannibal! I respected with her before I was married
       to her! If ever I was respected with her, or she
       with me, let not your worship think me the poor
       duke's officer. Prove this, thou wicked Hannibal, or
       I'll have mine action of battery on thee. 625

     * Escalus. If he took you a box o' the ear, you might have your
       action of slander too.

     * Elbow. Marry, I thank your good worship for it. What is't
       your worship's pleasure I shall do with this wicked caitiff?

     * Escalus. Truly, officer, because he hath some offences in him 630
       that thou wouldst discover if thou couldst, let him
       continue in his courses till thou knowest what they
       are.

     * Elbow. Marry, I thank your worship for it. Thou seest, thou
       wicked varlet, now, what's come upon thee: thou art 635
       to continue now, thou varlet; thou art to continue.

     * Escalus. Where were you born, friend?

     * Froth. Here in Vienna, sir.

     * Escalus. Are you of fourscore pounds a year?

     * Froth. Yes, an't please you, sir. 640

     * Escalus. So. What trade are you of, sir?

     * Pompey. Tapster; a poor widow's tapster.

     * Escalus. Your mistress' name?

     * Pompey. Mistress Overdone.

     * Escalus. Hath she had any more than one husband? 645

     * Pompey. Nine, sir; Overdone by the last.

     * Escalus. Nine! Come hither to me, Master Froth. Master
       Froth, I would not have you acquainted with
       tapsters: they will draw you, Master Froth, and you
       will hang them. Get you gone, and let me hear no 650
       more of you.

     * Froth. I thank your worship. For mine own part, I never
       come into any room in a tap-house, but I am drawn
       in.

     * Escalus. Well, no more of it, Master Froth: farewell. 655
       [Exit FROTH]
       Come you hither to me, Master tapster. What's your
       name, Master tapster?

     * Pompey. Pompey.

     * Escalus. What else? 660

     * Pompey. Bum, sir.

     * Escalus. Troth, and your bum is the greatest thing about you;
       so that in the beastliest sense you are Pompey the
       Great. Pompey, you are partly a bawd, Pompey,
       howsoever you colour it in being a tapster, are you 665
       not? come, tell me true: it shall be the better for you.

     * Pompey. Truly, sir, I am a poor fellow that would live.

     * Escalus. How would you live, Pompey? by being a bawd? What
       do you think of the trade, Pompey? is it a lawful trade?

     * Pompey. If the law would allow it, sir. 670

     * Escalus. But the law will not allow it, Pompey; nor it shall
       not be allowed in Vienna.

     * Pompey. Does your worship mean to geld and splay all the
       youth of the city?

     * Escalus. No, Pompey. 675

     * Pompey. Truly, sir, in my poor opinion, they will to't then.
       If your worship will take order for the drabs and
       the knaves, you need not to fear the bawds.

     * Escalus. There are pretty orders beginning, I can tell you:
       it is but heading and hanging. 680

     * Pompey. If you head and hang all that offend that way but
       for ten year together, you'll be glad to give out a
       commission for more heads: if this law hold in
       Vienna ten year, I'll rent the fairest house in it
       after three-pence a bay: if you live to see this 685
       come to pass, say Pompey told you so.

     * Escalus. Thank you, good Pompey; and, in requital of your
       prophecy, hark you: I advise you, let me not find
       you before me again upon any complaint whatsoever;
       no, not for dwelling where you do: if I do, Pompey, 690
       I shall beat you to your tent, and prove a shrewd
       Caesar to you; in plain dealing, Pompey, I shall
       have you whipt: so, for this time, Pompey, fare you well.

     * Pompey. I thank your worship for your good counsel:
       [Aside] 695
       but I shall follow it as the flesh and fortune shall
       better determine.
       Whip me? No, no; let carman whip his jade:
       The valiant heart is not whipt out of his trade.

   [Exit]
     * Escalus. Come hither to me, Master Elbow; come hither, Master
       constable. How long have you been in this place of constable?

     * Elbow. Seven year and a half, sir.

     * Escalus. I thought, by your readiness in the office, you had
       continued in it some time. You say, seven years together? 705

     * Elbow. And a half, sir.

     * Escalus. Alas, it hath been great pains to you. They do you
       wrong to put you so oft upon 't: are there not men
       in your ward sufficient to serve it?

     * Elbow. Faith, sir, few of any wit in such matters: as they 710
       are chosen, they are glad to choose me for them; I
       do it for some piece of money, and go through with
       all.

     * Escalus. Look you bring me in the names of some six or seven,
       the most sufficient of your parish. 715

     * Elbow. To your worship's house, sir?

     * Escalus. To my house. Fare you well.
       [Exit ELBOW]
       What's o'clock, think you?

     * Justice. Eleven, sir. 720

     * Escalus. I pray you home to dinner with me.

     * Justice. I humbly thank you.

     * Escalus. It grieves me for the death of Claudio;
       But there's no remedy.

     * Justice. Lord Angelo is severe. 725

     * Escalus. It is but needful:
       Mercy is not itself, that oft looks so;
       Pardon is still the nurse of second woe:
       But yet,—poor Claudio! There is no remedy.
       Come, sir. 730

   [Exeunt]

   Act II, Scene 2

   Another room in the same.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   [Enter Provost and a Servant]
     * Servant. He's hearing of a cause; he will come straight
       I'll tell him of you.

     * Provost. Pray you, do. 735
       [Exit Servant]
       I'll know
       His pleasure; may be he will relent. Alas,
       He hath but as offended in a dream!
       All sects, all ages smack of this vice; and he 740
       To die for't!

   [Enter ANGELO]
     * Angelo. Now, what's the matter. Provost?

     * Provost. Is it your will Claudio shall die tomorrow?

     * Angelo. Did not I tell thee yea? hadst thou not order? 745
       Why dost thou ask again?

     * Provost. Lest I might be too rash:
       Under your good correction, I have seen,
       When, after execution, judgment hath
       Repented o'er his doom. 750

     * Angelo. Go to; let that be mine:
       Do you your office, or give up your place,
       And you shall well be spared.

     * Provost. I crave your honour's pardon.
       What shall be done, sir, with the groaning Juliet? 755
       She's very near her hour.

     * Angelo. Dispose of her
       To some more fitter place, and that with speed.

   [Re-enter Servant]
     * Servant. Here is the sister of the man condemn'd 760
       Desires access to you.

     * Angelo. Hath he a sister?

     * Provost. Ay, my good lord; a very virtuous maid,
       And to be shortly of a sisterhood,
       If not already. 765

     * Angelo. Well, let her be admitted.
       [Exit Servant]
       See you the fornicatress be removed:
       Let have needful, but not lavish, means;
       There shall be order for't. 770

   [Enter ISABELLA and LUCIO]
     * Provost. God save your honour!

     * Angelo. Stay a little while.
       [To ISABELLA]
       You're welcome: what's your will? 775

     * Isabella. I am a woeful suitor to your honour,
       Please but your honour hear me.

     * Angelo. Well; what's your suit?

     * Isabella. There is a vice that most I do abhor,
       And most desire should meet the blow of justice; 780
       For which I would not plead, but that I must;
       For which I must not plead, but that I am
       At war 'twixt will and will not.

     * Angelo. Well; the matter?

     * Isabella. I have a brother is condemn'd to die: 785
       I do beseech you, let it be his fault,
       And not my brother.

     * Provost. [Aside] Heaven give thee moving graces!

     * Angelo. Condemn the fault and not the actor of it?
       Why, every fault's condemn'd ere it be done: 790
       Mine were the very cipher of a function,
       To fine the faults whose fine stands in record,
       And let go by the actor.

     * Isabella. O just but severe law!
       I had a brother, then. Heaven keep your honour! 795

     * Lucio. [Aside to ISABELLA] Give't not o'er so: to him
       again, entreat him;
       Kneel down before him, hang upon his gown:
       You are too cold; if you should need a pin,
       You could not with more tame a tongue desire it: 800
       To him, I say!

     * Isabella. Must he needs die?

     * Angelo. Maiden, no remedy.

     * Isabella. Yes; I do think that you might pardon him,
       And neither heaven nor man grieve at the mercy. 805

     * Angelo. I will not do't.

     * Isabella. But can you, if you would?

     * Angelo. Look, what I will not, that I cannot do.

     * Isabella. But might you do't, and do the world no wrong,
       If so your heart were touch'd with that remorse 810
       As mine is to him?

     * Angelo. He's sentenced; 'tis too late.

     * Lucio. [Aside to ISABELLA] You are too cold.

     * Isabella. Too late? why, no; I, that do speak a word.
       May call it back again. Well, believe this, 815
       No ceremony that to great ones 'longs,
       Not the king's crown, nor the deputed sword,
       The marshal's truncheon, nor the judge's robe,
       Become them with one half so good a grace
       As mercy does. 820
       If he had been as you and you as he,
       You would have slipt like him; but he, like you,
       Would not have been so stern.

     * Angelo. Pray you, be gone.

     * Isabella. I would to heaven I had your potency, 825
       And you were Isabel! should it then be thus?
       No; I would tell what 'twere to be a judge,
       And what a prisoner.

     * Lucio. [Aside to ISABELLA]
       Ay, touch him; there's the vein. 830

     * Angelo. Your brother is a forfeit of the law,
       And you but waste your words.

     * Isabella. Alas, alas!
       Why, all the souls that were were forfeit once;
       And He that might the vantage best have took 835
       Found out the remedy. How would you be,
       If He, which is the top of judgment, should
       But judge you as you are? O, think on that;
       And mercy then will breathe within your lips,
       Like man new made. 840

     * Angelo. Be you content, fair maid;
       It is the law, not I condemn your brother:
       Were he my kinsman, brother, or my son,
       It should be thus with him: he must die tomorrow.

     * Isabella. To-morrow! O, that's sudden! Spare him, spare him! 845
       He's not prepared for death. Even for our kitchens
       We kill the fowl of season: shall we serve heaven
       With less respect than we do minister
       To our gross selves? Good, good my lord, bethink you;
       Who is it that hath died for this offence? 850
       There's many have committed it.

     * Lucio. [Aside to ISABELLA] Ay, well said.

     * Angelo. The law hath not been dead, though it hath slept:
       Those many had not dared to do that evil,
       If the first that did the edict infringe 855
       Had answer'd for his deed: now 'tis awake
       Takes note of what is done; and, like a prophet,
       Looks in a glass, that shows what future evils,
       Either new, or by remissness new-conceived,
       And so in progress to be hatch'd and born, 860
       Are now to have no successive degrees,
       But, ere they live, to end.

     * Isabella. Yet show some pity.

     * Angelo. I show it most of all when I show justice;
       For then I pity those I do not know, 865
       Which a dismiss'd offence would after gall;
       And do him right that, answering one foul wrong,
       Lives not to act another. Be satisfied;
       Your brother dies to-morrow; be content.

     * Isabella. So you must be the first that gives this sentence, 870
       And he, that suffer's. O, it is excellent
       To have a giant's strength; but it is tyrannous
       To use it like a giant.

     * Lucio. [Aside to ISABELLA] That's well said.

     * Isabella. Could great men thunder 875
       As Jove himself does, Jove would ne'er be quiet,
       For every pelting, petty officer
       Would use his heaven for thunder;
       Nothing but thunder! Merciful Heaven,
       Thou rather with thy sharp and sulphurous bolt 880
       Split'st the unwedgeable and gnarled oak
       Than the soft myrtle: but man, proud man,
       Drest in a little brief authority,
       Most ignorant of what he's most assured,
       His glassy essence, like an angry ape, 885
       Plays such fantastic tricks before high heaven
       As make the angels weep; who, with our spleens,
       Would all themselves laugh mortal.

     * Lucio. [Aside to ISABELLA] O, to him, to him, wench! he
       will relent; 890
       He's coming; I perceive 't.

     * Provost. [Aside] Pray heaven she win him!

     * Isabella. We cannot weigh our brother with ourself:
       Great men may jest with saints; 'tis wit in them,
       But in the less foul profanation. 895

     * Lucio. Thou'rt i' the right, girl; more o, that.

     * Isabella. That in the captain's but a choleric word,
       Which in the soldier is flat blasphemy.

     * Lucio. [Aside to ISABELLA] Art avised o' that? more on 't.

     * Angelo. Why do you put these sayings upon me? 900

     * Isabella. Because authority, though it err like others,
       Hath yet a kind of medicine in itself,
       That skins the vice o' the top. Go to your bosom;
       Knock there, and ask your heart what it doth know
       That's like my brother's fault: if it confess 905
       A natural guiltiness such as is his,
       Let it not sound a thought upon your tongue
       Against my brother's life.

     * Angelo. [Aside] She speaks, and 'tis
       Such sense, that my sense breeds with it. Fare you well. 910

     * Isabella. Gentle my lord, turn back.

     * Angelo. I will bethink me: come again tomorrow.

     * Isabella. Hark how I'll bribe you: good my lord, turn back.

     * Angelo. How! bribe me?

     * Isabella. Ay, with such gifts that heaven shall share with you. 915

     * Lucio. [Aside to ISABELLA] You had marr'd all else.

     * Isabella. Not with fond shekels of the tested gold,
       Or stones whose rates are either rich or poor
       As fancy values them; but with true prayers
       That shall be up at heaven and enter there 920
       Ere sun-rise, prayers from preserved souls,
       From fasting maids whose minds are dedicate
       To nothing temporal.

     * Angelo. Well; come to me to-morrow.

     * Lucio. [Aside to ISABELLA] Go to; 'tis well; away! 925

     * Isabella. Heaven keep your honour safe!

     * Angelo. [Aside]. Amen:
       For I am that way going to temptation,
       Where prayers cross.

     * Isabella. At what hour to-morrow 930
       Shall I attend your lordship?

     * Angelo. At any time 'fore noon.

     * Isabella. 'Save your honour!

   [Exeunt ISABELLA, LUCIO, and Provost]
     * Angelo. From thee, even from thy virtue! 935
       What's this, what's this? Is this her fault or mine?
       The tempter or the tempted, who sins most?
       Ha!
       Not she: nor doth she tempt: but it is I
       That, lying by the violet in the sun, 940
       Do as the carrion does, not as the flower,
       Corrupt with virtuous season. Can it be
       That modesty may more betray our sense
       Than woman's lightness? Having waste ground enough,
       Shall we desire to raze the sanctuary 945
       And pitch our evils there? O, fie, fie, fie!
       What dost thou, or what art thou, Angelo?
       Dost thou desire her foully for those things
       That make her good? O, let her brother live!
       Thieves for their robbery have authority 950
       When judges steal themselves. What, do I love her,
       That I desire to hear her speak again,
       And feast upon her eyes? What is't I dream on?
       O cunning enemy, that, to catch a saint,
       With saints dost bait thy hook! Most dangerous 955
       Is that temptation that doth goad us on
       To sin in loving virtue: never could the strumpet,
       With all her double vigour, art and nature,
       Once stir my temper; but this virtuous maid
       Subdues me quite. Even till now, 960
       When men were fond, I smiled and wonder'd how.

   Act II, Scene 3

   A room in a prison.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   [Enter, severally, DUKE VINCENTIO disguised as a] [p]friar, and
   Provost]
     * Vincentio. Hail to you, provost! so I think you are. 965

     * Provost. I am the provost. What's your will, good friar?

     * Vincentio. Bound by my charity and my blest order,
       I come to visit the afflicted spirits
       Here in the prison. Do me the common right
       To let me see them and to make me know 970
       The nature of their crimes, that I may minister
       To them accordingly.

     * Provost. I would do more than that, if more were needful.
       [Enter JULIET]
       Look, here comes one: a gentlewoman of mine, 975
       Who, falling in the flaws of her own youth,
       Hath blister'd her report: she is with child;
       And he that got it, sentenced; a young man
       More fit to do another such offence
       Than die for this. 980

     * Vincentio. When must he die?

     * Provost. As I do think, to-morrow.
       I have provided for you: stay awhile,
       [To JULIET]
       And you shall be conducted. 985

     * Vincentio. Repent you, fair one, of the sin you carry?

     * Juliet. I do; and bear the shame most patiently.

     * Vincentio. I'll teach you how you shall arraign your conscience,
       And try your penitence, if it be sound,
       Or hollowly put on. 990

     * Juliet. I'll gladly learn.

     * Vincentio. Love you the man that wrong'd you?

     * Juliet. Yes, as I love the woman that wrong'd him.

     * Vincentio. So then it seems your most offenceful act
       Was mutually committed? 995

     * Juliet. Mutually.

     * Vincentio. Then was your sin of heavier kind than his.

     * Juliet. I do confess it, and repent it, father.

     * Vincentio. 'Tis meet so, daughter: but lest you do repent,
       As that the sin hath brought you to this shame, 1000
       Which sorrow is always towards ourselves, not heaven,
       Showing we would not spare heaven as we love it,
       But as we stand in fear,—

     * Juliet. I do repent me, as it is an evil,
       And take the shame with joy. 1005

     * Vincentio. There rest.
       Your partner, as I hear, must die to-morrow,
       And I am going with instruction to him.
       Grace go with you, Benedicite!

   [Exit]
     * Juliet. Must die to-morrow! O injurious love,
       That respites me a life, whose very comfort
       Is still a dying horror!

     * Provost. 'Tis pity of him.

   [Exeunt]

   Act II, Scene 4

   A room in ANGELO’s house.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   [Enter ANGELO]
     * Angelo. When I would pray and think, I think and pray
       To several subjects. Heaven hath my empty words;
       Whilst my invention, hearing not my tongue,
       Anchors on Isabel: Heaven in my mouth, 1020
       As if I did but only chew his name;
       And in my heart the strong and swelling evil
       Of my conception. The state, whereon I studied
       Is like a good thing, being often read,
       Grown fear'd and tedious; yea, my gravity, 1025
       Wherein—let no man hear me—I take pride,
       Could I with boot change for an idle plume,
       Which the air beats for vain. O place, O form,
       How often dost thou with thy case, thy habit,
       Wrench awe from fools and tie the wiser souls 1030
       To thy false seeming! Blood, thou art blood:
       Let's write good angel on the devil's horn:
       'Tis not the devil's crest.
       [Enter a Servant]
       How now! who's there? 1035

     * Servant. One Isabel, a sister, desires access to you.

     * Angelo. Teach her the way.
       [Exit Servant]
       O heavens!
       Why does my blood thus muster to my heart, 1040
       Making both it unable for itself,
       And dispossessing all my other parts
       Of necessary fitness?
       So play the foolish throngs with one that swoons;
       Come all to help him, and so stop the air 1045
       By which he should revive: and even so
       The general, subject to a well-wish'd king,
       Quit their own part, and in obsequious fondness
       Crowd to his presence, where their untaught love
       Must needs appear offence. 1050
       [Enter ISABELLA]
       How now, fair maid?

     * Isabella. I am come to know your pleasure.

     * Angelo. That you might know it, would much better please me
       Than to demand what 'tis. Your brother cannot live. 1055

     * Isabella. Even so. Heaven keep your honour!

     * Angelo. Yet may he live awhile; and, it may be,
       As long as you or I. yet he must die.

     * Isabella. Under your sentence?

     * Angelo. Yea. 1060

     * Isabella. When, I beseech you? that in his reprieve,
       Longer or shorter, he may be so fitted
       That his soul sicken not.

     * Angelo. Ha! fie, these filthy vices! It were as good
       To pardon him that hath from nature stolen 1065
       A man already made, as to remit
       Their saucy sweetness that do coin heaven's image
       In stamps that are forbid: 'tis all as easy
       Falsely to take away a life true made
       As to put metal in restrained means 1070
       To make a false one.

     * Isabella. 'Tis set down so in heaven, but not in earth.

     * Angelo. Say you so? then I shall pose you quickly.
       Which had you rather, that the most just law
       Now took your brother's life; or, to redeem him, 1075
       Give up your body to such sweet uncleanness
       As she that he hath stain'd?

     * Isabella. Sir, believe this,
       I had rather give my body than my soul.

     * Angelo. I talk not of your soul: our compell'd sins 1080
       Stand more for number than for accompt.

     * Isabella. How say you?

     * Angelo. Nay, I'll not warrant that; for I can speak
       Against the thing I say. Answer to this:
       I, now the voice of the recorded law, 1085
       Pronounce a sentence on your brother's life:
       Might there not be a charity in sin
       To save this brother's life?

     * Isabella. Please you to do't,
       I'll take it as a peril to my soul, 1090
       It is no sin at all, but charity.

     * Angelo. Pleased you to do't at peril of your soul,
       Were equal poise of sin and charity.

     * Isabella. That I do beg his life, if it be sin,
       Heaven let me bear it! you granting of my suit, 1095
       If that be sin, I'll make it my morn prayer
       To have it added to the faults of mine,
       And nothing of your answer.

     * Angelo. Nay, but hear me.
       Your sense pursues not mine: either you are ignorant, 1100
       Or seem so craftily; and that's not good.

     * Isabella. Let me be ignorant, and in nothing good,
       But graciously to know I am no better.

     * Angelo. Thus wisdom wishes to appear most bright
       When it doth tax itself; as these black masks 1105
       Proclaim an enshield beauty ten times louder
       Than beauty could, display'd. But mark me;
       To be received plain, I'll speak more gross:
       Your brother is to die.

     * Isabella. So. 1110

     * Angelo. And his offence is so, as it appears,
       Accountant to the law upon that pain.

     * Isabella. True.

     * Angelo. Admit no other way to save his life,—
       As I subscribe not that, nor any other, 1115
       But in the loss of question,—that you, his sister,
       Finding yourself desired of such a person,
       Whose credit with the judge, or own great place,
       Could fetch your brother from the manacles
       Of the all-building law; and that there were 1120
       No earthly mean to save him, but that either
       You must lay down the treasures of your body
       To this supposed, or else to let him suffer;
       What would you do?

     * Isabella. As much for my poor brother as myself: 1125
       That is, were I under the terms of death,
       The impression of keen whips I'ld wear as rubies,
       And strip myself to death, as to a bed
       That longing have been sick for, ere I'ld yield
       My body up to shame. 1130

     * Angelo. Then must your brother die.

     * Isabella. And 'twere the cheaper way:
       Better it were a brother died at once,
       Than that a sister, by redeeming him,
       Should die for ever. 1135

     * Angelo. Were not you then as cruel as the sentence
       That you have slander'd so?

     * Isabella. Ignomy in ransom and free pardon
       Are of two houses: lawful mercy
       Is nothing kin to foul redemption. 1140

     * Angelo. You seem'd of late to make the law a tyrant;
       And rather proved the sliding of your brother
       A merriment than a vice.

     * Isabella. O, pardon me, my lord; it oft falls out,
       To have what we would have, we speak not what we mean: 1145
       I something do excuse the thing I hate,
       For his advantage that I dearly love.

     * Angelo. We are all frail.

     * Isabella. Else let my brother die,
       If not a feodary, but only he 1150
       Owe and succeed thy weakness.

     * Angelo. Nay, women are frail too.

     * Isabella. Ay, as the glasses where they view themselves;
       Which are as easy broke as they make forms.
       Women! Help Heaven! men their creation mar 1155
       In profiting by them. Nay, call us ten times frail;
       For we are soft as our complexions are,
       And credulous to false prints.

     * Angelo. I think it well:
       And from this testimony of your own sex,— 1160
       Since I suppose we are made to be no stronger
       Than faults may shake our frames,—let me be bold;
       I do arrest your words. Be that you are,
       That is, a woman; if you be more, you're none;
       If you be one, as you are well express'd 1165
       By all external warrants, show it now,
       By putting on the destined livery.

     * Isabella. I have no tongue but one: gentle my lord,
       Let me entreat you speak the former language.

     * Angelo. Plainly conceive, I love you. 1170

     * Isabella. My brother did love Juliet,
       And you tell me that he shall die for it.

     * Angelo. He shall not, Isabel, if you give me love.

     * Isabella. I know your virtue hath a licence in't,
       Which seems a little fouler than it is, 1175
       To pluck on others.

     * Angelo. Believe me, on mine honour,
       My words express my purpose.

     * Isabella. Ha! little honour to be much believed,
       And most pernicious purpose! Seeming, seeming! 1180
       I will proclaim thee, Angelo; look for't:
       Sign me a present pardon for my brother,
       Or with an outstretch'd throat I'll tell the world aloud
       What man thou art.

     * Angelo. Who will believe thee, Isabel? 1185
       My unsoil'd name, the austereness of my life,
       My vouch against you, and my place i' the state,
       Will so your accusation overweigh,
       That you shall stifle in your own report
       And smell of calumny. I have begun, 1190
       And now I give my sensual race the rein:
       Fit thy consent to my sharp appetite;
       Lay by all nicety and prolixious blushes,
       That banish what they sue for; redeem thy brother
       By yielding up thy body to my will; 1195
       Or else he must not only die the death,
       But thy unkindness shall his death draw out
       To lingering sufferance. Answer me to-morrow,
       Or, by the affection that now guides me most,
       I'll prove a tyrant to him. As for you, 1200
       Say what you can, my false o'erweighs your true.

   [Exit]
     * Isabella. To whom should I complain? Did I tell this,
       Who would believe me? O perilous mouths,
       That bear in them one and the self-same tongue, 1205
       Either of condemnation or approof;
       Bidding the law make court'sy to their will:
       Hooking both right and wrong to the appetite,
       To follow as it draws! I'll to my brother:
       Though he hath fallen by prompture of the blood, 1210
       Yet hath he in him such a mind of honour.
       That, had he twenty heads to tender down
       On twenty bloody blocks, he'ld yield them up,
       Before his sister should her body stoop
       To such abhorr'd pollution. 1215
       Then, Isabel, live chaste, and, brother, die:
       More than our brother is our chastity.
       I'll tell him yet of Angelo's request,
       And fit his mind to death, for his soul's rest.

   [Exit]

   Act III, Scene 1

   A room in the prison.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   [Enter DUKE VINCENTIO disguised as before, CLAUDIO,] [p]and Provost]
     * Vincentio. So then you hope of pardon from Lord Angelo?

     * Claudio. The miserable have no other medicine
       But only hope: 1225
       I've hope to live, and am prepared to die.

     * Vincentio. Be absolute for death; either death or life
       Shall thereby be the sweeter. Reason thus with life:
       If I do lose thee, I do lose a thing
       That none but fools would keep: a breath thou art, 1230
       Servile to all the skyey influences,
       That dost this habitation, where thou keep'st,
       Hourly afflict: merely, thou art death's fool;
       For him thou labour'st by thy flight to shun
       And yet runn'st toward him still. Thou art not noble; 1235
       For all the accommodations that thou bear'st
       Are nursed by baseness. Thou'rt by no means valiant;
       For thou dost fear the soft and tender fork
       Of a poor worm. Thy best of rest is sleep,
       And that thou oft provokest; yet grossly fear'st 1240
       Thy death, which is no more. Thou art not thyself;
       For thou exist'st on many a thousand grains
       That issue out of dust. Happy thou art not;
       For what thou hast not, still thou strivest to get,
       And what thou hast, forget'st. Thou art not certain; 1245
       For thy complexion shifts to strange effects,
       After the moon. If thou art rich, thou'rt poor;
       For, like an ass whose back with ingots bows,
       Thou bear's thy heavy riches but a journey,
       And death unloads thee. Friend hast thou none; 1250
       For thine own bowels, which do call thee sire,
       The mere effusion of thy proper loins,
       Do curse the gout, serpigo, and the rheum,
       For ending thee no sooner. Thou hast nor youth nor age,
       But, as it were, an after-dinner's sleep, 1255
       Dreaming on both; for all thy blessed youth
       Becomes as aged, and doth beg the alms
       Of palsied eld; and when thou art old and rich,
       Thou hast neither heat, affection, limb, nor beauty,
       To make thy riches pleasant. What's yet in this 1260
       That bears the name of life? Yet in this life
       Lie hid moe thousand deaths: yet death we fear,
       That makes these odds all even.

     * Claudio. I humbly thank you.
       To sue to live, I find I seek to die; 1265
       And, seeking death, find life: let it come on.

     * Isabella. [Within] What, ho! Peace here; grace and good company!

     * Provost. Who's there? come in: the wish deserves a welcome.

     * Vincentio. Dear sir, ere long I'll visit you again.

     * Claudio. Most holy sir, I thank you. 1270

   [Enter ISABELLA]
     * Isabella. My business is a word or two with Claudio.

     * Provost. And very welcome. Look, signior, here's your sister.

     * Vincentio. Provost, a word with you.

     * Provost. As many as you please. 1275

     * Vincentio. Bring me to hear them speak, where I may be concealed.

   [Exeunt DUKE VINCENTIO and Provost]
     * Claudio. Now, sister, what's the comfort?

     * Isabella. Why,
       As all comforts are; most good, most good indeed. 1280
       Lord Angelo, having affairs to heaven,
       Intends you for his swift ambassador,
       Where you shall be an everlasting leiger:
       Therefore your best appointment make with speed;
       To-morrow you set on. 1285

     * Claudio. Is there no remedy?

     * Isabella. None, but such remedy as, to save a head,
       To cleave a heart in twain.

     * Claudio. But is there any?

     * Isabella. Yes, brother, you may live: 1290
       There is a devilish mercy in the judge,
       If you'll implore it, that will free your life,
       But fetter you till death.

     * Claudio. Perpetual durance?

     * Isabella. Ay, just; perpetual durance, a restraint, 1295
       Though all the world's vastidity you had,
       To a determined scope.

     * Claudio. But in what nature?

     * Isabella. In such a one as, you consenting to't,
       Would bark your honour from that trunk you bear, 1300
       And leave you naked.

     * Claudio. Let me know the point.

     * Isabella. O, I do fear thee, Claudio; and I quake,
       Lest thou a feverous life shouldst entertain,
       And six or seven winters more respect 1305
       Than a perpetual honour. Darest thou die?
       The sense of death is most in apprehension;
       And the poor beetle, that we tread upon,
       In corporal sufferance finds a pang as great
       As when a giant dies. 1310

     * Claudio. Why give you me this shame?
       Think you I can a resolution fetch
       From flowery tenderness? If I must die,
       I will encounter darkness as a bride,
       And hug it in mine arms. 1315

     * Isabella. There spake my brother; there my father's grave
       Did utter forth a voice. Yes, thou must die:
       Thou art too noble to conserve a life
       In base appliances. This outward-sainted deputy,
       Whose settled visage and deliberate word 1320
       Nips youth i' the head and follies doth emmew
       As falcon doth the fowl, is yet a devil
       His filth within being cast, he would appear
       A pond as deep as hell.

     * Claudio. The prenzie Angelo! 1325

     * Isabella. O, 'tis the cunning livery of hell,
       The damned'st body to invest and cover
       In prenzie guards! Dost thou think, Claudio?
       If I would yield him my virginity,
       Thou mightst be freed. 1330

     * Claudio. O heavens! it cannot be.

     * Isabella. Yes, he would give't thee, from this rank offence,
       So to offend him still. This night's the time
       That I should do what I abhor to name,
       Or else thou diest to-morrow. 1335

     * Claudio. Thou shalt not do't.

     * Isabella. O, were it but my life,
       I'ld throw it down for your deliverance
       As frankly as a pin.

     * Claudio. Thanks, dear Isabel. 1340

     * Isabella. Be ready, Claudio, for your death tomorrow.

     * Claudio. Yes. Has he affections in him,
       That thus can make him bite the law by the nose,
       When he would force it? Sure, it is no sin,
       Or of the deadly seven, it is the least. 1345

     * Isabella. Which is the least?

     * Claudio. If it were damnable, he being so wise,
       Why would he for the momentary trick
       Be perdurably fined? O Isabel!

     * Isabella. What says my brother? 1350

     * Claudio. Death is a fearful thing.

     * Isabella. And shamed life a hateful.

     * Claudio. Ay, but to die, and go we know not where;
       To lie in cold obstruction and to rot;
       This sensible warm motion to become 1355
       A kneaded clod; and the delighted spirit
       To bathe in fiery floods, or to reside
       In thrilling region of thick-ribbed ice;
       To be imprison'd in the viewless winds,
       And blown with restless violence round about 1360
       The pendent world; or to be worse than worst
       Of those that lawless and incertain thought
       Imagine howling: 'tis too horrible!
       The weariest and most loathed worldly life
       That age, ache, penury and imprisonment 1365
       Can lay on nature is a paradise
       To what we fear of death.

     * Isabella. Alas, alas!

     * Claudio. Sweet sister, let me live:
       What sin you do to save a brother's life, 1370
       Nature dispenses with the deed so far
       That it becomes a virtue.

     * Isabella. O you beast!
       O faithless coward! O dishonest wretch!
       Wilt thou be made a man out of my vice? 1375
       Is't not a kind of incest, to take life
       From thine own sister's shame? What should I think?
       Heaven shield my mother play'd my father fair!
       For such a warped slip of wilderness
       Ne'er issued from his blood. Take my defiance! 1380
       Die, perish! Might but my bending down
       Reprieve thee from thy fate, it should proceed:
       I'll pray a thousand prayers for thy death,
       No word to save thee.

     * Claudio. Nay, hear me, Isabel. 1385

     * Isabella. O, fie, fie, fie!
       Thy sin's not accidental, but a trade.
       Mercy to thee would prove itself a bawd:
       'Tis best thou diest quickly.

     * Claudio. O hear me, Isabella! 1390

   [Re-enter DUKE VINCENTIO]
     * Vincentio. Vouchsafe a word, young sister, but one word.

     * Isabella. What is your will?

     * Vincentio. Might you dispense with your leisure, I would by and
       by have some speech with you: the satisfaction I 1395
       would require is likewise your own benefit.

     * Isabella. I have no superfluous leisure; my stay must be
       stolen out of other affairs; but I will attend you awhile.

   [Walks apart]
     * Vincentio. Son, I have overheard what hath passed between you 1400
       and your sister. Angelo had never the purpose to
       corrupt her; only he hath made an essay of her
       virtue to practise his judgment with the disposition
       of natures: she, having the truth of honour in her,
       hath made him that gracious denial which he is most 1405
       glad to receive. I am confessor to Angelo, and I
       know this to be true; therefore prepare yourself to
       death: do not satisfy your resolution with hopes
       that are fallible: tomorrow you must die; go to
       your knees and make ready. 1410

     * Claudio. Let me ask my sister pardon. I am so out of love
       with life that I will sue to be rid of it.

     * Vincentio. Hold you there: farewell.
       [Exit CLAUDIO]
       Provost, a word with you! 1415

   [Re-enter Provost]
     * Provost. What's your will, father

     * Vincentio. That now you are come, you will be gone. Leave me
       awhile with the maid: my mind promises with my
       habit no loss shall touch her by my company. 1420

     * Provost. In good time.

   [Exit Provost. ISABELLA comes forward]
     * Vincentio. The hand that hath made you fair hath made you good:
       the goodness that is cheap in beauty makes beauty
       brief in goodness; but grace, being the soul of 1425
       your complexion, shall keep the body of it ever
       fair. The assault that Angelo hath made to you,
       fortune hath conveyed to my understanding; and, but
       that frailty hath examples for his falling, I should
       wonder at Angelo. How will you do to content this 1430
       substitute, and to save your brother?

     * Isabella. I am now going to resolve him: I had rather my
       brother die by the law than my son should be
       unlawfully born. But, O, how much is the good duke
       deceived in Angelo! If ever he return and I can 1435
       speak to him, I will open my lips in vain, or
       discover his government.

     * Vincentio. That shall not be much amiss: Yet, as the matter
       now stands, he will avoid your accusation; he made
       trial of you only. Therefore fasten your ear on my 1440
       advisings: to the love I have in doing good a
       remedy presents itself. I do make myself believe
       that you may most uprighteously do a poor wronged
       lady a merited benefit; redeem your brother from
       the angry law; do no stain to your own gracious 1445
       person; and much please the absent duke, if
       peradventure he shall ever return to have hearing of
       this business.

     * Isabella. Let me hear you speak farther. I have spirit to do
       anything that appears not foul in the truth of my spirit. 1450

     * Vincentio. Virtue is bold, and goodness never fearful. Have
       you not heard speak of Mariana, the sister of
       Frederick the great soldier who miscarried at sea?

     * Isabella. I have heard of the lady, and good words went with her
       name.

     * Vincentio. She should this Angelo have married; was affianced 1455
       to her by oath, and the nuptial appointed: between
       which time of the contract and limit of the
       solemnity, her brother Frederick was wrecked at sea,
       having in that perished vessel the dowry of his
       sister. But mark how heavily this befell to the 1460
       poor gentlewoman: there she lost a noble and
       renowned brother, in his love toward her ever most
       kind and natural; with him, the portion and sinew of
       her fortune, her marriage-dowry; with both, her
       combinate husband, this well-seeming Angelo. 1465

     * Isabella. Can this be so? did Angelo so leave her?

     * Vincentio. Left her in her tears, and dried not one of them
       with his comfort; swallowed his vows whole,
       pretending in her discoveries of dishonour: in few,
       bestowed her on her own lamentation, which she yet 1470
       wears for his sake; and he, a marble to her tears,
       is washed with them, but relents not.

     * Isabella. What a merit were it in death to take this poor maid
       from the world! What corruption in this life, that
       it will let this man live! But how out of this can she avail? 1475

     * Vincentio. It is a rupture that you may easily heal: and the
       cure of it not only saves your brother, but keeps
       you from dishonour in doing it.

     * Isabella. Show me how, good father.

     * Vincentio. This forenamed maid hath yet in her the continuance 1480
       of her first affection: his unjust unkindness, that
       in all reason should have quenched her love, hath,
       like an impediment in the current, made it more
       violent and unruly. Go you to Angelo; answer his
       requiring with a plausible obedience; agree with 1485
       his demands to the point; only refer yourself to
       this advantage, first, that your stay with him may
       not be long; that the time may have all shadow and
       silence in it; and the place answer to convenience.
       This being granted in course,—and now follows 1490
       all,—we shall advise this wronged maid to stead up
       your appointment, go in your place; if the encounter
       acknowledge itself hereafter, it may compel him to
       her recompense: and here, by this, is your brother
       saved, your honour untainted, the poor Mariana 1495
       advantaged, and the corrupt deputy scaled. The maid
       will I frame and make fit for his attempt. If you
       think well to carry this as you may, the doubleness
       of the benefit defends the deceit from reproof.
       What think you of it? 1500

     * Isabella. The image of it gives me content already; and I
       trust it will grow to a most prosperous perfection.

     * Vincentio. It lies much in your holding up. Haste you speedily
       to Angelo: if for this night he entreat you to his
       bed, give him promise of satisfaction. I will 1505
       presently to Saint Luke's: there, at the moated
       grange, resides this dejected Mariana. At that
       place call upon me; and dispatch with Angelo, that
       it may be quickly.

     * Isabella. I thank you for this comfort. Fare you well, good father.
       1510

   Act III, Scene 2

   The street before the prison.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   [Enter, on one side, DUKE VINCENTIO disguised as] [p]before; on the
   other, ELBOW, and Officers with POMPEY]
     * Elbow. Nay, if there be no remedy for it, but that you will
       needs buy and sell men and women like beasts, we 1515
       shall have all the world drink brown and white bastard.

     * Vincentio. O heavens! what stuff is here

     * Pompey. 'Twas never merry world since, of two usuries, the
       merriest was put down, and the worser allowed by
       order of law a furred gown to keep him warm; and 1520
       furred with fox and lamb-skins too, to signify, that
       craft, being richer than innocency, stands for the facing.

     * Elbow. Come your way, sir. 'Bless you, good father friar.

     * Vincentio. And you, good brother father. What offence hath
       this man made you, sir? 1525

     * Elbow. Marry, sir, he hath offended the law: and, sir, we
       take him to be a thief too, sir; for we have found
       upon him, sir, a strange picklock, which we have
       sent to the deputy.

     * Vincentio. Fie, sirrah! a bawd, a wicked bawd! 1530
       The evil that thou causest to be done,
       That is thy means to live. Do thou but think
       What 'tis to cram a maw or clothe a back
       From such a filthy vice: say to thyself,
       From their abominable and beastly touches 1535
       I drink, I eat, array myself, and live.
       Canst thou believe thy living is a life,
       So stinkingly depending? Go mend, go mend.

     * Pompey. Indeed, it does stink in some sort, sir; but yet,
       sir, I would prove— 1540

     * Vincentio. Nay, if the devil have given thee proofs for sin,
       Thou wilt prove his. Take him to prison, officer:
       Correction and instruction must both work
       Ere this rude beast will profit.

     * Elbow. He must before the deputy, sir; he has given him 1545
       warning: the deputy cannot abide a whoremaster: if
       he be a whoremonger, and comes before him, he were
       as good go a mile on his errand.

     * Vincentio. That we were all, as some would seem to be,
       From our faults, as faults from seeming, free! 1550

     * Elbow. His neck will come to your waist,—a cord, sir.

     * Pompey. I spy comfort; I cry bail. Here's a gentleman and a
       friend of mine.

   [Enter LUCIO]
     * Lucio. How now, noble Pompey! What, at the wheels of 1555
       Caesar? art thou led in triumph? What, is there
       none of Pygmalion's images, newly made woman, to be
       had now, for putting the hand in the pocket and
       extracting it clutch'd? What reply, ha? What
       sayest thou to this tune, matter and method? Is't 1560
       not drowned i' the last rain, ha? What sayest
       thou, Trot? Is the world as it was, man? Which is
       the way? Is it sad, and few words? or how? The
       trick of it?

     * Vincentio. Still thus, and thus; still worse! 1565

     * Lucio. How doth my dear morsel, thy mistress? Procures she
       still, ha?

     * Pompey. Troth, sir, she hath eaten up all her beef, and she
       is herself in the tub.

     * Lucio. Why, 'tis good; it is the right of it; it must be 1570
       so: ever your fresh whore and your powdered bawd:
       an unshunned consequence; it must be so. Art going
       to prison, Pompey?

     * Pompey. Yes, faith, sir.

     * Lucio. Why, 'tis not amiss, Pompey. Farewell: go, say I 1575
       sent thee thither. For debt, Pompey? or how?

     * Elbow. For being a bawd, for being a bawd.

     * Lucio. Well, then, imprison him: if imprisonment be the
       due of a bawd, why, 'tis his right: bawd is he
       doubtless, and of antiquity too; bawd-born. 1580
       Farewell, good Pompey. Commend me to the prison,
       Pompey: you will turn good husband now, Pompey; you
       will keep the house.

     * Pompey. I hope, sir, your good worship will be my bail.

     * Lucio. No, indeed, will I not, Pompey; it is not the wear. 1585
       I will pray, Pompey, to increase your bondage: If
       you take it not patiently, why, your mettle is the
       more. Adieu, trusty Pompey. 'Bless you, friar.

     * Vincentio. And you.

     * Lucio. Does Bridget paint still, Pompey, ha? 1590

     * Elbow. Come your ways, sir; come.

     * Pompey. You will not bail me, then, sir?

     * Lucio. Then, Pompey, nor now. What news abroad, friar?
       what news?

     * Elbow. Come your ways, sir; come. 1595

     * Lucio. Go to kennel, Pompey; go.
       [Exeunt ELBOW, POMPEY and Officers]
       What news, friar, of the duke?

     * Vincentio. I know none. Can you tell me of any?

     * Lucio. Some say he is with the Emperor of Russia; other 1600
       some, he is in Rome: but where is he, think you?

     * Vincentio. I know not where; but wheresoever, I wish him well.

     * Lucio. It was a mad fantastical trick of him to steal from
       the state, and usurp the beggary he was never born
       to. Lord Angelo dukes it well in his absence; he 1605
       puts transgression to 't.

     * Vincentio. He does well in 't.

     * Lucio. A little more lenity to lechery would do no harm in
       him: something too crabbed that way, friar.

     * Vincentio. It is too general a vice, and severity must cure it.
       1610

     * Lucio. Yes, in good sooth, the vice is of a great kindred;
       it is well allied: but it is impossible to extirp
       it quite, friar, till eating and drinking be put
       down. They say this Angelo was not made by man and
       woman after this downright way of creation: is it 1615
       true, think you?

     * Vincentio. How should he be made, then?

     * Lucio. Some report a sea-maid spawned him; some, that he
       was begot between two stock-fishes. But it is
       certain that when he makes water his urine is 1620
       congealed ice; that I know to be true: and he is a
       motion generative; that's infallible.

     * Vincentio. You are pleasant, sir, and speak apace.

     * Lucio. Why, what a ruthless thing is this in him, for the
       rebellion of a codpiece to take away the life of a 1625
       man! Would the duke that is absent have done this?
       Ere he would have hanged a man for the getting a
       hundred bastards, he would have paid for the nursing
       a thousand: he had some feeling of the sport: he
       knew the service, and that instructed him to mercy. 1630

     * Vincentio. I never heard the absent duke much detected for
       women; he was not inclined that way.

     * Lucio. O, sir, you are deceived.

     * Vincentio. 'Tis not possible.

     * Lucio. Who, not the duke? yes, your beggar of fifty; and 1635
       his use was to put a ducat in her clack-dish: the
       duke had crotchets in him. He would be drunk too;
       that let me inform you.

     * Vincentio. You do him wrong, surely.

     * Lucio. Sir, I was an inward of his. A shy fellow was the 1640
       duke: and I believe I know the cause of his
       withdrawing.

     * Vincentio. What, I prithee, might be the cause?

     * Lucio. No, pardon; 'tis a secret must be locked within the
       teeth and the lips: but this I can let you 1645
       understand, the greater file of the subject held the
       duke to be wise.

     * Vincentio. Wise! why, no question but he was.

     * Lucio. A very superficial, ignorant, unweighing fellow.

     * Vincentio. Either this is the envy in you, folly, or mistaking:
       1650
       the very stream of his life and the business he hath
       helmed must upon a warranted need give him a better
       proclamation. Let him be but testimonied in his own
       bringings-forth, and he shall appear to the
       envious a scholar, a statesman and a soldier. 1655
       Therefore you speak unskilfully: or if your
       knowledge be more it is much darkened in your malice.

     * Lucio. Sir, I know him, and I love him.

     * Vincentio. Love talks with better knowledge, and knowledge with
       dearer love. 1660

     * Lucio. Come, sir, I know what I know.

     * Vincentio. I can hardly believe that, since you know not what
       you speak. But, if ever the duke return, as our
       prayers are he may, let me desire you to make your
       answer before him. If it be honest you have spoke, 1665
       you have courage to maintain it: I am bound to call
       upon you; and, I pray you, your name?

     * Lucio. Sir, my name is Lucio; well known to the duke.

     * Vincentio. He shall know you better, sir, if I may live to
       report you. 1670

     * Lucio. I fear you not.

     * Vincentio. O, you hope the duke will return no more; or you
       imagine me too unhurtful an opposite. But indeed I
       can do you little harm; you'll forswear this again.

     * Lucio. I'll be hanged first: thou art deceived in me, 1675
       friar. But no more of this. Canst thou tell if
       Claudio die to-morrow or no?

     * Vincentio. Why should he die, sir?

     * Lucio. Why? For filling a bottle with a tundish. I would
       the duke we talk of were returned again: the 1680
       ungenitured agent will unpeople the province with
       continency; sparrows must not build in his
       house-eaves, because they are lecherous. The duke
       yet would have dark deeds darkly answered; he would
       never bring them to light: would he were returned! 1685
       Marry, this Claudio is condemned for untrussing.
       Farewell, good friar: I prithee, pray for me. The
       duke, I say to thee again, would eat mutton on
       Fridays. He's not past it yet, and I say to thee,
       he would mouth with a beggar, though she smelt brown 1690
       bread and garlic: say that I said so. Farewell.

   [Exit]
     * Vincentio. No might nor greatness in mortality
       Can censure 'scape; back-wounding calumny
       The whitest virtue strikes. What king so strong 1695
       Can tie the gall up in the slanderous tongue?
       But who comes here?

   [Enter ESCALUS, Provost, and Officers with MISTRESS OVERDONE]
     * Escalus. Go; away with her to prison!

     * Mistress Overdone. Good my lord, be good to me; your honour is
       accounted 1700
       a merciful man; good my lord.

     * Escalus. Double and treble admonition, and still forfeit in
       the same kind! This would make mercy swear and play
       the tyrant.

     * Provost. A bawd of eleven years' continuance, may it please 1705
       your honour.

     * Mistress Overdone. My lord, this is one Lucio's information against
       me.
       Mistress Kate Keepdown was with child by him in the
       duke's time; he promised her marriage: his child
       is a year and a quarter old, come Philip and Jacob: 1710
       I have kept it myself; and see how he goes about to abuse me!

     * Escalus. That fellow is a fellow of much licence: let him be
       called before us. Away with her to prison! Go to;
       no more words.
       [Exeunt Officers with MISTRESS OVERDONE] 1715
       Provost, my brother Angelo will not be altered;
       Claudio must die to-morrow: let him be furnished
       with divines, and have all charitable preparation.
       if my brother wrought by my pity, it should not be
       so with him. 1720

     * Provost. So please you, this friar hath been with him, and
       advised him for the entertainment of death.

     * Escalus. Good even, good father.

     * Vincentio. Bliss and goodness on you!

     * Escalus. Of whence are you? 1725

     * Vincentio. Not of this country, though my chance is now
       To use it for my time: I am a brother
       Of gracious order, late come from the See
       In special business from his holiness.

     * Escalus. What news abroad i' the world? 1730

     * Vincentio. None, but that there is so great a fever on
       goodness, that the dissolution of it must cure it:
       novelty is only in request; and it is as dangerous
       to be aged in any kind of course, as it is virtuous
       to be constant in any undertaking. There is scarce 1735
       truth enough alive to make societies secure; but
       security enough to make fellowships accurst: much
       upon this riddle runs the wisdom of the world. This
       news is old enough, yet it is every day's news. I
       pray you, sir, of what disposition was the duke? 1740

     * Escalus. One that, above all other strifes, contended
       especially to know himself.

     * Vincentio. What pleasure was he given to?

     * Escalus. Rather rejoicing to see another merry, than merry at
       any thing which professed to make him rejoice: a 1745
       gentleman of all temperance. But leave we him to
       his events, with a prayer they may prove prosperous;
       and let me desire to know how you find Claudio
       prepared. I am made to understand that you have
       lent him visitation. 1750

     * Vincentio. He professes to have received no sinister measure
       from his judge, but most willingly humbles himself
       to the determination of justice: yet had he framed
       to himself, by the instruction of his frailty, many
       deceiving promises of life; which I by my good 1755
       leisure have discredited to him, and now is he
       resolved to die.

     * Escalus. You have paid the heavens your function, and the
       prisoner the very debt of your calling. I have
       laboured for the poor gentleman to the extremest 1760
       shore of my modesty: but my brother justice have I
       found so severe, that he hath forced me to tell him
       he is indeed Justice.

     * Vincentio. If his own life answer the straitness of his
       proceeding, it shall become him well; wherein if he 1765
       chance to fail, he hath sentenced himself.

     * Escalus. I am going to visit the prisoner. Fare you well.

     * Vincentio. Peace be with you!
       [Exeunt ESCALUS and Provost]
       He who the sword of heaven will bear 1770
       Should be as holy as severe;
       Pattern in himself to know,
       Grace to stand, and virtue go;
       More nor less to others paying
       Than by self-offences weighing. 1775
       Shame to him whose cruel striking
       Kills for faults of his own liking!
       Twice treble shame on Angelo,
       To weed my vice and let his grow!
       O, what may man within him hide, 1780
       Though angel on the outward side!
       How may likeness made in crimes,
       Making practise on the times,
       To draw with idle spiders' strings
       Most ponderous and substantial things! 1785
       Craft against vice I must apply:
       With Angelo to-night shall lie
       His old betrothed but despised;
       So disguise shall, by the disguised,
       Pay with falsehood false exacting, 1790
       And perform an old contracting.

   [Enter MARIANA and a Boy] [p][Boy sings] [p]Take, O, take those lips
   away, [p]That so sweetly were forsworn; [p]And those eyes, the break of
   day, [p]Lights that do mislead the morn: [p]But my kisses bring again,
   bring again; [p]Seals of love, but sealed in vain, sealed in vain.
     * Mariana. Break off thy song, and haste thee quick away:
       Here comes a man of comfort, whose advice
       Hath often still'd my brawling discontent.
       [Exit Boy]
       [Enter DUKE VINCENTIO disguised as before] 1805
       I cry you mercy, sir; and well could wish
       You had not found me here so musical:
       Let me excuse me, and believe me so,
       My mirth it much displeased, but pleased my woe.

     * Vincentio. 'Tis good; though music oft hath such a charm 1810
       To make bad good, and good provoke to harm.
       I pray, you, tell me, hath any body inquired
       for me here to-day? much upon this time have
       I promised here to meet.

     * Mariana. You have not been inquired after: 1815
       I have sat here all day.

   [Enter ISABELLA]
     * Vincentio. I do constantly believe you. The time is come even
       now. I shall crave your forbearance a little: may
       be I will call upon you anon, for some advantage to yourself. 1820

     * Mariana. I am always bound to you.

   [Exit]
     * Vincentio. Very well met, and well come.
       What is the news from this good deputy?

     * Isabella. He hath a garden circummured with brick, 1825
       Whose western side is with a vineyard back'd;
       And to that vineyard is a planched gate,
       That makes his opening with this bigger key:
       This other doth command a little door
       Which from the vineyard to the garden leads; 1830
       There have I made my promise
       Upon the heavy middle of the night
       To call upon him.

     * Vincentio. But shall you on your knowledge find this way?

     * Isabella. I have ta'en a due and wary note upon't: 1835
       With whispering and most guilty diligence,
       In action all of precept, he did show me
       The way twice o'er.

     * Vincentio. Are there no other tokens
       Between you 'greed concerning her observance? 1840

     * Isabella. No, none, but only a repair i' the dark;
       And that I have possess'd him my most stay
       Can be but brief; for I have made him know
       I have a servant comes with me along,
       That stays upon me, whose persuasion is 1845
       I come about my brother.

     * Vincentio. 'Tis well borne up.
       I have not yet made known to Mariana
       A word of this. What, ho! within! come forth!
       [Re-enter MARIANA] 1850
       I pray you, be acquainted with this maid;
       She comes to do you good.

     * Isabella. I do desire the like.

     * Vincentio. Do you persuade yourself that I respect you?

     * Mariana. Good friar, I know you do, and have found it. 1855

     * Vincentio. Take, then, this your companion by the hand,
       Who hath a story ready for your ear.
       I shall attend your leisure: but make haste;
       The vaporous night approaches.

     * Mariana. Will't please you walk aside? 1860

   [Exeunt MARIANA and ISABELLA]
     * Vincentio. O place and greatness! millions of false eyes
       Are stuck upon thee: volumes of report
       Run with these false and most contrarious quests
       Upon thy doings: thousand escapes of wit 1865
       Make thee the father of their idle dreams
       And rack thee in their fancies.
       [Re-enter MARIANA and ISABELLA]
       Welcome, how agreed?

     * Isabella. She'll take the enterprise upon her, father, 1870
       If you advise it.

     * Vincentio. It is not my consent,
       But my entreaty too.

     * Isabella. Little have you to say
       When you depart from him, but, soft and low, 1875
       'Remember now my brother.'

     * Mariana. Fear me not.

     * Vincentio. Nor, gentle daughter, fear you not at all.
       He is your husband on a pre-contract:
       To bring you thus together, 'tis no sin, 1880
       Sith that the justice of your title to him
       Doth flourish the deceit. Come, let us go:
       Our corn's to reap, for yet our tithe's to sow.

   Act IV, Scene 2

   A room in the prison.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   [Enter Provost and POMPEY]
     * Provost. Come hither, sirrah. Can you cut off a man's head?

     * Pompey. If the man be a bachelor, sir, I can; but if he be a
       married man, he's his wife's head, and I can never
       cut off a woman's head.

     * Provost. Come, sir, leave me your snatches, and yield me a 1890
       direct answer. To-morrow morning are to die Claudio
       and Barnardine. Here is in our prison a common
       executioner, who in his office lacks a helper: if
       you will take it on you to assist him, it shall
       redeem you from your gyves; if not, you shall have 1895
       your full time of imprisonment and your deliverance
       with an unpitied whipping, for you have been a
       notorious bawd.

     * Pompey. Sir, I have been an unlawful bawd time out of mind;
       but yet I will be content to be a lawful hangman. I 1900
       would be glad to receive some instruction from my
       fellow partner.

     * Provost. What, ho! Abhorson! Where's Abhorson, there?

   [Enter ABHORSON]
     * Abhorson. Do you call, sir? 1905

     * Provost. Sirrah, here's a fellow will help you to-morrow in
       your execution. If you think it meet, compound with
       him by the year, and let him abide here with you; if
       not, use him for the present and dismiss him. He
       cannot plead his estimation with you; he hath been a bawd. 1910

     * Abhorson. A bawd, sir? fie upon him! he will discredit our mystery.

     * Provost. Go to, sir; you weigh equally; a feather will turn
       the scale.

   [Exit]
     * Pompey. Pray, sir, by your good favour,—for surely, sir, a 1915
       good favour you have, but that you have a hanging
       look,—do you call, sir, your occupation a mystery?

     * Abhorson. Ay, sir; a mystery

     * Pompey. Painting, sir, I have heard say, is a mystery; and
       your whores, sir, being members of my occupation, 1920
       using painting, do prove my occupation a mystery:
       but what mystery there should be in hanging, if I
       should be hanged, I cannot imagine.

     * Abhorson. Sir, it is a mystery.

     * Pompey. Proof? 1925

     * Abhorson. Every true man's apparel fits your thief: if it be
       too little for your thief, your true man thinks it
       big enough; if it be too big for your thief, your
       thief thinks it little enough: so every true man's
       apparel fits your thief. 1930

   [Re-enter Provost]
     * Provost. Are you agreed?

     * Pompey. Sir, I will serve him; for I do find your hangman is
       a more penitent trade than your bawd; he doth
       oftener ask forgiveness. 1935

     * Provost. You, sirrah, provide your block and your axe
       to-morrow four o'clock.

     * Abhorson. Come on, bawd; I will instruct thee in my trade; follow.

     * Pompey. I do desire to learn, sir: and I hope, if you have
       occasion to use me for your own turn, you shall find 1940
       me yare; for truly, sir, for your kindness I owe you
       a good turn.

     * Provost. Call hither Barnardine and Claudio:
       [Exeunt POMPEY and ABHORSON]
       The one has my pity; not a jot the other, 1945
       Being a murderer, though he were my brother.
       [Enter CLAUDIO]
       Look, here's the warrant, Claudio, for thy death:
       'Tis now dead midnight, and by eight to-morrow
       Thou must be made immortal. Where's Barnardine? 1950

     * Claudio. As fast lock'd up in sleep as guiltless labour
       When it lies starkly in the traveller's bones:
       He will not wake.

     * Provost. Who can do good on him?
       Well, go, prepare yourself. 1955
       [Knocking within]
       But, hark, what noise?
       Heaven give your spirits comfort!
       [Exit CLAUDIO]
       By and by. 1960
       I hope it is some pardon or reprieve
       For the most gentle Claudio.
       [Enter DUKE VINCENTIO disguised as before]
       Welcome father.

     * Vincentio. The best and wholesomest spirts of the night 1965
       Envelope you, good Provost! Who call'd here of late?

     * Provost. None, since the curfew rung.

     * Vincentio. Not Isabel?

     * Provost. No.

     * Vincentio. They will, then, ere't be long. 1970

     * Provost. What comfort is for Claudio?

     * Vincentio. There's some in hope.

     * Provost. It is a bitter deputy.

     * Vincentio. Not so, not so; his life is parallel'd
       Even with the stroke and line of his great justice: 1975
       He doth with holy abstinence subdue
       That in himself which he spurs on his power
       To qualify in others: were he meal'd with that
       Which he corrects, then were he tyrannous;
       But this being so, he's just. 1980
       [Knocking within]
       Now are they come.
       [Exit Provost]
       This is a gentle provost: seldom when
       The steeled gaoler is the friend of men. 1985
       [Knocking within]
       How now! what noise? That spirit's possessed with haste
       That wounds the unsisting postern with these strokes.

   [Re-enter Provost]
     * Provost. There he must stay until the officer 1990
       Arise to let him in: he is call'd up.

     * Vincentio. Have you no countermand for Claudio yet,
       But he must die to-morrow?

     * Provost. None, sir, none.

     * Vincentio. As near the dawning, provost, as it is, 1995
       You shall hear more ere morning.

     * Provost. Happily
       You something know; yet I believe there comes
       No countermand; no such example have we:
       Besides, upon the very siege of justice 2000
       Lord Angelo hath to the public ear
       Profess'd the contrary.
       [Enter a Messenger]
       This is his lordship's man.

     * Vincentio. And here comes Claudio's pardon. 2005

     * Messenger. [Giving a paper]
       My lord hath sent you this note; and by me this
       further charge, that you swerve not from the
       smallest article of it, neither in time, matter, or
       other circumstance. Good morrow; for, as I take it, 2010
       it is almost day.

     * Provost. I shall obey him.

   [Exit Messenger]
     * Vincentio. [Aside] This is his pardon, purchased by such sin
       For which the pardoner himself is in. 2015
       Hence hath offence his quick celerity,
       When it is born in high authority:
       When vice makes mercy, mercy's so extended,
       That for the fault's love is the offender friended.
       Now, sir, what news? 2020

     * Provost. I told you. Lord Angelo, belike thinking me remiss
       in mine office, awakens me with this unwonted
       putting-on; methinks strangely, for he hath not used it before.

     * Vincentio. Pray you, let's hear.

     * Provost. [Reads] 2025
       'Whatsoever you may hear to the contrary, let
       Claudio be executed by four of the clock; and in the
       afternoon Barnardine: for my better satisfaction,
       let me have Claudio's head sent me by five. Let
       this be duly performed; with a thought that more 2030
       depends on it than we must yet deliver. Thus fail
       not to do your office, as you will answer it at your peril.'
       What say you to this, sir?

     * Vincentio. What is that Barnardine who is to be executed in the
       afternoon? 2035

     * Provost. A Bohemian born, but here nursed un and bred; one
       that is a prisoner nine years old.

     * Vincentio. How came it that the absent duke had not either
       delivered him to his liberty or executed him? I
       have heard it was ever his manner to do so. 2040

     * Provost. His friends still wrought reprieves for him: and,
       indeed, his fact, till now in the government of Lord
       Angelo, came not to an undoubtful proof.

     * Vincentio. It is now apparent?

     * Provost. Most manifest, and not denied by himself. 2045

     * Vincentio. Hath he born himself penitently in prison? how
       seems he to be touched?

     * Provost. A man that apprehends death no more dreadfully but
       as a drunken sleep; careless, reckless, and fearless
       of what's past, present, or to come; insensible of 2050
       mortality, and desperately mortal.

     * Vincentio. He wants advice.

     * Provost. He will hear none: he hath evermore had the liberty
       of the prison; give him leave to escape hence, he
       would not: drunk many times a day, if not many days 2055
       entirely drunk. We have very oft awaked him, as if
       to carry him to execution, and showed him a seeming
       warrant for it: it hath not moved him at all.

     * Vincentio. More of him anon. There is written in your brow,
       provost, honesty and constancy: if I read it not 2060
       truly, my ancient skill beguiles me; but, in the
       boldness of my cunning, I will lay myself in hazard.
       Claudio, whom here you have warrant to execute, is
       no greater forfeit to the law than Angelo who hath
       sentenced him. To make you understand this in a 2065
       manifested effect, I crave but four days' respite;
       for the which you are to do me both a present and a
       dangerous courtesy.

     * Provost. Pray, sir, in what?

     * Vincentio. In the delaying death. 2070

     * Provost. A lack, how may I do it, having the hour limited,
       and an express command, under penalty, to deliver
       his head in the view of Angelo? I may make my case
       as Claudio's, to cross this in the smallest.

     * Vincentio. By the vow of mine order I warrant you, if my 2075
       instructions may be your guide. Let this Barnardine
       be this morning executed, and his head born to Angelo.

     * Provost. Angelo hath seen them both, and will discover the favour.

     * Vincentio. O, death's a great disguiser; and you may add to it.
       Shave the head, and tie the beard; and say it was 2080
       the desire of the penitent to be so bared before his
       death: you know the course is common. If any thing
       fall to you upon this, more than thanks and good
       fortune, by the saint whom I profess, I will plead
       against it with my life. 2085

     * Provost. Pardon me, good father; it is against my oath.

     * Vincentio. Were you sworn to the duke, or to the deputy?

     * Provost. To him, and to his substitutes.

     * Vincentio. You will think you have made no offence, if the duke
       avouch the justice of your dealing? 2090

     * Provost. But what likelihood is in that?

     * Vincentio. Not a resemblance, but a certainty. Yet since I see
       you fearful, that neither my coat, integrity, nor
       persuasion can with ease attempt you, I will go
       further than I meant, to pluck all fears out of you. 2095
       Look you, sir, here is the hand and seal of the
       duke: you know the character, I doubt not; and the
       signet is not strange to you.

     * Provost. I know them both.

     * Vincentio. The contents of this is the return of the duke: you 2100
       shall anon over-read it at your pleasure; where you
       shall find, within these two days he will be here.
       This is a thing that Angelo knows not; for he this
       very day receives letters of strange tenor;
       perchance of the duke's death; perchance entering 2105
       into some monastery; but, by chance, nothing of what
       is writ. Look, the unfolding star calls up the
       shepherd. Put not yourself into amazement how these
       things should be: all difficulties are but easy
       when they are known. Call your executioner, and off 2110
       with Barnardine's head: I will give him a present
       shrift and advise him for a better place. Yet you
       are amazed; but this shall absolutely resolve you.
       Come away; it is almost clear dawn.

   Act IV, Scene 3

   Another room in the same.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   [Enter POMPEY]
     * Pompey. I am as well acquainted here as I was in our house
       of profession: one would think it were Mistress
       Overdone's own house, for here be many of her old
       customers. First, here's young Master Rash; he's in 2120
       for a commodity of brown paper and old ginger,
       ninescore and seventeen pounds; of which he made
       five marks, ready money: marry, then ginger was not
       much in request, for the old women were all dead.
       Then is there here one Master Caper, at the suit of 2125
       Master Three-pile the mercer, for some four suits of
       peach-coloured satin, which now peaches him a
       beggar. Then have we here young Dizy, and young
       Master Deep-vow, and Master Copperspur, and Master
       Starve-lackey the rapier and dagger man, and young 2130
       Drop-heir that killed lusty Pudding, and Master
       Forthlight the tilter, and brave Master Shooty the
       great traveller, and wild Half-can that stabbed
       Pots, and, I think, forty more; all great doers in
       our trade, and are now 'for the Lord's sake.' 2135

   [Enter ABHORSON]
     * Abhorson. Sirrah, bring Barnardine hither.

     * Pompey. Master Barnardine! you must rise and be hanged.
       Master Barnardine!

     * Abhorson. What, ho, Barnardine! 2140

     * Barnardine. [Within] A pox o' your throats! Who makes that
       noise there? What are you?

     * Pompey. Your friends, sir; the hangman. You must be so
       good, sir, to rise and be put to death.

     * Barnardine. [Within] Away, you rogue, away! I am sleepy. 2145

     * Abhorson. Tell him he must awake, and that quickly too.

     * Pompey. Pray, Master Barnardine, awake till you are
       executed, and sleep afterwards.

     * Abhorson. Go in to him, and fetch him out.

     * Pompey. He is coming, sir, he is coming; I hear his straw rustle.
       2150

     * Abhorson. Is the axe upon the block, sirrah?

     * Pompey. Very ready, sir.

   [Enter BARNARDINE]
     * Barnardine. How now, Abhorson? what's the news with you?

     * Abhorson. Truly, sir, I would desire you to clap into your 2155
       prayers; for, look you, the warrant's come.

     * Barnardine. You rogue, I have been drinking all night; I am not
       fitted for 't.

     * Pompey. O, the better, sir; for he that drinks all night,
       and is hanged betimes in the morning, may sleep the 2160
       sounder all the next day.

     * Abhorson. Look you, sir; here comes your ghostly father: do
       we jest now, think you?

   [Enter DUKE VINCENTIO disguised as before]
     * Vincentio. Sir, induced by my charity, and hearing how hastily 2165
       you are to depart, I am come to advise you, comfort
       you and pray with you.

     * Barnardine. Friar, not I. I have been drinking hard all night,
       and I will have more time to prepare me, or they
       shall beat out my brains with billets: I will not 2170
       consent to die this day, that's certain.

     * Vincentio. O, sir, you must: and therefore I beseech you
       Look forward on the journey you shall go.

     * Barnardine. I swear I will not die to-day for any man's
       persuasion. 2175

     * Vincentio. But hear you.

     * Barnardine. Not a word: if you have any thing to say to me,
       come to my ward; for thence will not I to-day.

   [Exit]
     * Vincentio. Unfit to live or die: O gravel heart! 2180
       After him, fellows; bring him to the block.

   [Exeunt ABHORSON and POMPEY]

   [Re-enter Provost]
     * Provost. Now, sir, how do you find the prisoner?

     * Vincentio. A creature unprepared, unmeet for death; 2185
       And to transport him in the mind he is
       Were damnable.

     * Provost. Here in the prison, father,
       There died this morning of a cruel fever
       One Ragozine, a most notorious pirate, 2190
       A man of Claudio's years; his beard and head
       Just of his colour. What if we do omit
       This reprobate till he were well inclined;
       And satisfy the deputy with the visage
       Of Ragozine, more like to Claudio? 2195

     * Vincentio. O, 'tis an accident that heaven provides!
       Dispatch it presently; the hour draws on
       Prefix'd by Angelo: see this be done,
       And sent according to command; whiles I
       Persuade this rude wretch willingly to die. 2200

     * Provost. This shall be done, good father, presently.
       But Barnardine must die this afternoon:
       And how shall we continue Claudio,
       To save me from the danger that might come
       If he were known alive? 2205

     * Vincentio. Let this be done.
       Put them in secret holds, both Barnardine and Claudio:
       Ere twice the sun hath made his journal greeting
       To the under generation, you shall find
       Your safety manifested. 2210

     * Provost. I am your free dependant.

     * Vincentio. Quick, dispatch, and send the head to Angelo.
       [Exit Provost]
       Now will I write letters to Angelo,—
       The provost, he shall bear them, whose contents 2215
       Shall witness to him I am near at home,
       And that, by great injunctions, I am bound
       To enter publicly: him I'll desire
       To meet me at the consecrated fount
       A league below the city; and from thence, 2220
       By cold gradation and well-balanced form,
       We shall proceed with Angelo.

   [Re-enter Provost]
     * Provost. Here is the head; I'll carry it myself.

     * Vincentio. Convenient is it. Make a swift return; 2225
       For I would commune with you of such things
       That want no ear but yours.

     * Provost. I'll make all speed.

   [Exit]
     * Isabella. [Within] Peace, ho, be here! 2230

     * Vincentio. The tongue of Isabel. She's come to know
       If yet her brother's pardon be come hither:
       But I will keep her ignorant of her good,
       To make her heavenly comforts of despair,
       When it is least expected. 2235

   [Enter ISABELLA]
     * Isabella. Ho, by your leave!

     * Vincentio. Good morning to you, fair and gracious daughter.

     * Isabella. The better, given me by so holy a man.
       Hath yet the deputy sent my brother's pardon? 2240

     * Vincentio. He hath released him, Isabel, from the world:
       His head is off and sent to Angelo.

     * Isabella. Nay, but it is not so.

     * Vincentio. It is no other: show your wisdom, daughter,
       In your close patience. 2245

     * Isabella. O, I will to him and pluck out his eyes!

     * Vincentio. You shall not be admitted to his sight.

     * Isabella. Unhappy Claudio! wretched Isabel!
       Injurious world! most damned Angelo!

     * Vincentio. This nor hurts him nor profits you a jot; 2250
       Forbear it therefore; give your cause to heaven.
       Mark what I say, which you shall find
       By every syllable a faithful verity:
       The duke comes home to-morrow; nay, dry your eyes;
       One of our convent, and his confessor, 2255
       Gives me this instance: already he hath carried
       Notice to Escalus and Angelo,
       Who do prepare to meet him at the gates,
       There to give up their power. If you can, pace your wisdom
       In that good path that I would wish it go, 2260
       And you shall have your bosom on this wretch,
       Grace of the duke, revenges to your heart,
       And general honour.

     * Isabella. I am directed by you.

     * Vincentio. This letter, then, to Friar Peter give; 2265
       'Tis that he sent me of the duke's return:
       Say, by this token, I desire his company
       At Mariana's house to-night. Her cause and yours
       I'll perfect him withal, and he shall bring you
       Before the duke, and to the head of Angelo 2270
       Accuse him home and home. For my poor self,
       I am combined by a sacred vow
       And shall be absent. Wend you with this letter:
       Command these fretting waters from your eyes
       With a light heart; trust not my holy order, 2275
       If I pervert your course. Who's here?

   [Enter LUCIO]
     * Lucio. Good even. Friar, where's the provost?

     * Vincentio. Not within, sir.

     * Lucio. O pretty Isabella, I am pale at mine heart to see 2280
       thine eyes so red: thou must be patient. I am fain
       to dine and sup with water and bran; I dare not for
       my head fill my belly; one fruitful meal would set
       me to 't. But they say the duke will be here
       to-morrow. By my troth, Isabel, I loved thy brother: 2285
       if the old fantastical duke of dark corners had been
       at home, he had lived.

   [Exit ISABELLA]
     * Vincentio. Sir, the duke is marvellous little beholding to your
       reports; but the best is, he lives not in them. 2290

     * Lucio. Friar, thou knowest not the duke so well as I do:
       he's a better woodman than thou takest him for.

     * Vincentio. Well, you'll answer this one day. Fare ye well.

     * Lucio. Nay, tarry; I'll go along with thee
       I can tell thee pretty tales of the duke. 2295

     * Vincentio. You have told me too many of him already, sir, if
       they be true; if not true, none were enough.

     * Lucio. I was once before him for getting a wench with child.

     * Vincentio. Did you such a thing?

     * Lucio. Yes, marry, did I. but I was fain to forswear it; 2300
       they would else have married me to the rotten medlar.

     * Vincentio. Sir, your company is fairer than honest. Rest you well.

     * Lucio. By my troth, I'll go with thee to the lane's end:
       if bawdy talk offend you, we'll have very little of
       it. Nay, friar, I am a kind of burr; I shall stick. 2305

   [Exeunt]

   Act IV, Scene 4

   A room in ANGELO’s house.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   [Enter ANGELO and ESCALUS]
     * Escalus. Every letter he hath writ hath disvouched other.

     * Angelo. In most uneven and distracted manner. His actions
       show much like to madness: pray heaven his wisdom be 2310
       not tainted! And why meet him at the gates, and
       redeliver our authorities there

     * Escalus. I guess not.

     * Angelo. And why should we proclaim it in an hour before his
       entering, that if any crave redress of injustice, 2315
       they should exhibit their petitions in the street?

     * Escalus. He shows his reason for that: to have a dispatch of
       complaints, and to deliver us from devices
       hereafter, which shall then have no power to stand
       against us. 2320

     * Angelo. Well, I beseech you, let it be proclaimed betimes
       i' the morn; I'll call you at your house: give
       notice to such men of sort and suit as are to meet
       him.

     * Escalus. I shall, sir. Fare you well. 2325

     * Angelo. Good night.
       [Exit ESCALUS]
       This deed unshapes me quite, makes me unpregnant
       And dull to all proceedings. A deflower'd maid!
       And by an eminent body that enforced 2330
       The law against it! But that her tender shame
       Will not proclaim against her maiden loss,
       How might she tongue me! Yet reason dares her no;
       For my authority bears of a credent bulk,
       That no particular scandal once can touch 2335
       But it confounds the breather. He should have lived,
       Save that riotous youth, with dangerous sense,
       Might in the times to come have ta'en revenge,
       By so receiving a dishonour'd life
       With ransom of such shame. Would yet he had lived! 2340
       A lack, when once our grace we have forgot,
       Nothing goes right: we would, and we would not.

   Fields without the town.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   [Enter DUKE VINCENTIO in his own habit, and FRIAR PETER]
     * Vincentio. These letters at fit time deliver me 2345
       [Giving letters]
       The provost knows our purpose and our plot.
       The matter being afoot, keep your instruction,
       And hold you ever to our special drift;
       Though sometimes you do blench from this to that, 2350
       As cause doth minister. Go call at Flavius' house,
       And tell him where I stay: give the like notice
       To Valentinus, Rowland, and to Crassus,
       And bid them bring the trumpets to the gate;
       But send me Flavius first. 2355

     * Friar Peter. It shall be speeded well.

   [Exit]

   [Enter VARRIUS]
     * Vincentio. I thank thee, Varrius; thou hast made good haste:
       Come, we will walk. There's other of our friends 2360
       Will greet us here anon, my gentle Varrius.

   [Exeunt]

   Street near the city gate.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   [Enter ISABELLA and MARIANA]
     * Isabella. To speak so indirectly I am loath:
       I would say the truth; but to accuse him so, 2365
       That is your part: yet I am advised to do it;
       He says, to veil full purpose.

     * Mariana. Be ruled by him.

     * Isabella. Besides, he tells me that, if peradventure
       He speak against me on the adverse side, 2370
       I should not think it strange; for 'tis a physic
       That's bitter to sweet end.

     * Mariana. I would Friar Peter—

     * Isabella. O, peace! the friar is come.

   [Enter FRIAR PETER]
     * Friar Peter. Come, I have found you out a stand most fit,
       Where you may have such vantage on the duke,
       He shall not pass you. Twice have the trumpets sounded;
       The generous and gravest citizens
       Have hent the gates, and very near upon 2380
       The duke is entering: therefore, hence, away!

   [Exeunt]
   _______________________________________________________________________



   Act V, Scene 1

   The city gate.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   [MARIANA veiled, ISABELLA, and FRIAR PETER, at their] [p]stand. Enter
   DUKE VINCENTIO, VARRIUS, Lords, [p]ANGELO, ESCALUS, LUCIO, Provost,
   Officers, and [p]Citizens, at several doors]
     * Vincentio. My very worthy cousin, fairly met!
       Our old and faithful friend, we are glad to see you.

     * Angelo. [with Escalus] Happy return be to your royal grace!

     * Vincentio. Many and hearty thankings to you both. 2390
       We have made inquiry of you; and we hear
       Such goodness of your justice, that our soul
       Cannot but yield you forth to public thanks,
       Forerunning more requital.

     * Angelo. You make my bonds still greater. 2395

     * Vincentio. O, your desert speaks loud; and I should wrong it,
       To lock it in the wards of covert bosom,
       When it deserves, with characters of brass,
       A forted residence 'gainst the tooth of time
       And razure of oblivion. Give me your hand, 2400
       And let the subject see, to make them know
       That outward courtesies would fain proclaim
       Favours that keep within. Come, Escalus,
       You must walk by us on our other hand;
       And good supporters are you. 2405

   [FRIAR PETER and ISABELLA come forward]
     * Friar Peter. Now is your time: speak loud and kneel before him.

     * Isabella. Justice, O royal duke! Vail your regard
       Upon a wrong'd, I would fain have said, a maid!
       O worthy prince, dishonour not your eye 2410
       By throwing it on any other object
       Till you have heard me in my true complaint
       And given me justice, justice, justice, justice!

     * Vincentio. Relate your wrongs; in what? by whom? be brief.
       Here is Lord Angelo shall give you justice: 2415
       Reveal yourself to him.

     * Isabella. O worthy duke,
       You bid me seek redemption of the devil:
       Hear me yourself; for that which I must speak
       Must either punish me, not being believed, 2420
       Or wring redress from you. Hear me, O hear me, here!

     * Angelo. My lord, her wits, I fear me, are not firm:
       She hath been a suitor to me for her brother
       Cut off by course of justice,—

     * Isabella. By course of justice! 2425

     * Angelo. And she will speak most bitterly and strange.

     * Isabella. Most strange, but yet most truly, will I speak:
       That Angelo's forsworn; is it not strange?
       That Angelo's a murderer; is 't not strange?
       That Angelo is an adulterous thief, 2430
       An hypocrite, a virgin-violator;
       Is it not strange and strange?

     * Vincentio. Nay, it is ten times strange.

     * Isabella. It is not truer he is Angelo
       Than this is all as true as it is strange: 2435
       Nay, it is ten times true; for truth is truth
       To the end of reckoning.

     * Vincentio. Away with her! Poor soul,
       She speaks this in the infirmity of sense.

     * Isabella. O prince, I conjure thee, as thou believest 2440
       There is another comfort than this world,
       That thou neglect me not, with that opinion
       That I am touch'd with madness! Make not impossible
       That which but seems unlike: 'tis not impossible
       But one, the wicked'st caitiff on the ground, 2445
       May seem as shy, as grave, as just, as absolute
       As Angelo; even so may Angelo,
       In all his dressings, characts, titles, forms,
       Be an arch-villain; believe it, royal prince:
       If he be less, he's nothing; but he's more, 2450
       Had I more name for badness.

     * Vincentio. By mine honesty,
       If she be mad,—as I believe no other,—
       Her madness hath the oddest frame of sense,
       Such a dependency of thing on thing, 2455
       As e'er I heard in madness.

     * Isabella. O gracious duke,
       Harp not on that, nor do not banish reason
       For inequality; but let your reason serve
       To make the truth appear where it seems hid, 2460
       And hide the false seems true.

     * Vincentio. Many that are not mad
       Have, sure, more lack of reason. What would you say?

     * Isabella. I am the sister of one Claudio,
       Condemn'd upon the act of fornication 2465
       To lose his head; condemn'd by Angelo:
       I, in probation of a sisterhood,
       Was sent to by my brother; one Lucio
       As then the messenger,—

     * Lucio. That's I, an't like your grace: 2470
       I came to her from Claudio, and desired her
       To try her gracious fortune with Lord Angelo
       For her poor brother's pardon.

     * Isabella. That's he indeed.

     * Vincentio. You were not bid to speak. 2475

     * Lucio. No, my good lord;
       Nor wish'd to hold my peace.

     * Vincentio. I wish you now, then;
       Pray you, take note of it: and when you have
       A business for yourself, pray heaven you then 2480
       Be perfect.

     * Lucio. I warrant your honour.

     * Vincentio. The warrants for yourself; take heed to't.

     * Isabella. This gentleman told somewhat of my tale,—

     * Lucio. Right. 2485

     * Vincentio. It may be right; but you are i' the wrong
       To speak before your time. Proceed.

     * Isabella. I went
       To this pernicious caitiff deputy,—

     * Vincentio. That's somewhat madly spoken. 2490

     * Isabella. Pardon it;
       The phrase is to the matter.

     * Vincentio. Mended again. The matter; proceed.

     * Isabella. In brief, to set the needless process by,
       How I persuaded, how I pray'd, and kneel'd, 2495
       How he refell'd me, and how I replied,—
       For this was of much length,—the vile conclusion
       I now begin with grief and shame to utter:
       He would not, but by gift of my chaste body
       To his concupiscible intemperate lust, 2500
       Release my brother; and, after much debatement,
       My sisterly remorse confutes mine honour,
       And I did yield to him: but the next morn betimes,
       His purpose surfeiting, he sends a warrant
       For my poor brother's head. 2505

     * Vincentio. This is most likely!

     * Isabella. O, that it were as like as it is true!

     * Vincentio. By heaven, fond wretch, thou knowist not what thou
       speak'st,
       Or else thou art suborn'd against his honour
       In hateful practise. First, his integrity 2510
       Stands without blemish. Next, it imports no reason
       That with such vehemency he should pursue
       Faults proper to himself: if he had so offended,
       He would have weigh'd thy brother by himself
       And not have cut him off. Some one hath set you on: 2515
       Confess the truth, and say by whose advice
       Thou camest here to complain.

     * Isabella. And is this all?
       Then, O you blessed ministers above,
       Keep me in patience, and with ripen'd time 2520
       Unfold the evil which is here wrapt up
       In countenance! Heaven shield your grace from woe,
       As I, thus wrong'd, hence unbelieved go!

     * Vincentio. I know you'ld fain be gone. An officer!
       To prison with her! Shall we thus permit 2525
       A blasting and a scandalous breath to fall
       On him so near us? This needs must be a practise.
       Who knew of Your intent and coming hither?

     * Isabella. One that I would were here, Friar Lodowick.

     * Vincentio. A ghostly father, belike. Who knows that Lodowick? 2530

     * Lucio. My lord, I know him; 'tis a meddling friar;
       I do not like the man: had he been lay, my lord
       For certain words he spake against your grace
       In your retirement, I had swinged him soundly.

     * Vincentio. Words against me? this is a good friar, belike! 2535
       And to set on this wretched woman here
       Against our substitute! Let this friar be found.

     * Lucio. But yesternight, my lord, she and that friar,
       I saw them at the prison: a saucy friar,
       A very scurvy fellow. 2540

     * Friar Peter. Blessed be your royal grace!
       I have stood by, my lord, and I have heard
       Your royal ear abused. First, hath this woman
       Most wrongfully accused your substitute,
       Who is as free from touch or soil with her 2545
       As she from one ungot.

     * Vincentio. We did believe no less.
       Know you that Friar Lodowick that she speaks of?

     * Friar Peter. I know him for a man divine and holy;
       Not scurvy, nor a temporary meddler, 2550
       As he's reported by this gentleman;
       And, on my trust, a man that never yet
       Did, as he vouches, misreport your grace.

     * Lucio. My lord, most villanously; believe it.

     * Friar Peter. Well, he in time may come to clear himself; 2555
       But at this instant he is sick my lord,
       Of a strange fever. Upon his mere request,
       Being come to knowledge that there was complaint
       Intended 'gainst Lord Angelo, came I hither,
       To speak, as from his mouth, what he doth know 2560
       Is true and false; and what he with his oath
       And all probation will make up full clear,
       Whensoever he's convented. First, for this woman.
       To justify this worthy nobleman,
       So vulgarly and personally accused, 2565
       Her shall you hear disproved to her eyes,
       Till she herself confess it.

     * Vincentio. Good friar, let's hear it.
       [ISABELLA is carried off guarded; and MARIANA comes forward]
       Do you not smile at this, Lord Angelo? 2570
       O heaven, the vanity of wretched fools!
       Give us some seats. Come, cousin Angelo;
       In this I'll be impartial; be you judge
       Of your own cause. Is this the witness, friar?
       First, let her show her face, and after speak. 2575

     * Mariana. Pardon, my lord; I will not show my face
       Until my husband bid me.

     * Vincentio. What, are you married?

     * Mariana. No, my lord.

     * Vincentio. Are you a maid? 2580

     * Mariana. No, my lord.

     * Vincentio. A widow, then?

     * Mariana. Neither, my lord.

     * Vincentio. Why, you are nothing then: neither maid, widow, nor
       wife?

     * Lucio. My lord, she may be a punk; for many of them are 2585
       neither maid, widow, nor wife.

     * Vincentio. Silence that fellow: I would he had some cause
       To prattle for himself.

     * Lucio. Well, my lord.

     * Mariana. My lord; I do confess I ne'er was married; 2590
       And I confess besides I am no maid:
       I have known my husband; yet my husband
       Knows not that ever he knew me.

     * Lucio. He was drunk then, my lord: it can be no better.

     * Vincentio. For the benefit of silence, would thou wert so too! 2595

     * Lucio. Well, my lord.

     * Vincentio. This is no witness for Lord Angelo.

     * Mariana. Now I come to't my lord
       She that accuses him of fornication,
       In self-same manner doth accuse my husband, 2600
       And charges him my lord, with such a time
       When I'll depose I had him in mine arms
       With all the effect of love.

     * Angelo. Charges she more than me?

     * Mariana. Not that I know. 2605

     * Vincentio. No? you say your husband.

     * Mariana. Why, just, my lord, and that is Angelo,
       Who thinks he knows that he ne'er knew my body,
       But knows he thinks that he knows Isabel's.

     * Angelo. This is a strange abuse. Let's see thy face. 2610

     * Mariana. My husband bids me; now I will unmask.
       [Unveiling]
       This is that face, thou cruel Angelo,
       Which once thou sworest was worth the looking on;
       This is the hand which, with a vow'd contract, 2615
       Was fast belock'd in thine; this is the body
       That took away the match from Isabel,
       And did supply thee at thy garden-house
       In her imagined person.

     * Vincentio. Know you this woman? 2620

     * Lucio. Carnally, she says.

     * Vincentio. Sirrah, no more!

     * Lucio. Enough, my lord.

     * Angelo. My lord, I must confess I know this woman:
       And five years since there was some speech of marriage 2625
       Betwixt myself and her; which was broke off,
       Partly for that her promised proportions
       Came short of composition, but in chief
       For that her reputation was disvalued
       In levity: since which time of five years 2630
       I never spake with her, saw her, nor heard from her,
       Upon my faith and honour.

     * Mariana. Noble prince,
       As there comes light from heaven and words from breath,
       As there is sense in truth and truth in virtue, 2635
       I am affianced this man's wife as strongly
       As words could make up vows: and, my good lord,
       But Tuesday night last gone in's garden-house
       He knew me as a wife. As this is true,
       Let me in safety raise me from my knees 2640
       Or else for ever be confixed here,
       A marble monument!

     * Angelo. I did but smile till now:
       Now, good my lord, give me the scope of justice
       My patience here is touch'd. I do perceive 2645
       These poor informal women are no more
       But instruments of some more mightier member
       That sets them on: let me have way, my lord,
       To find this practise out.

     * Vincentio. Ay, with my heart 2650
       And punish them to your height of pleasure.
       Thou foolish friar, and thou pernicious woman,
       Compact with her that's gone, think'st thou thy oaths,
       Though they would swear down each particular saint,
       Were testimonies against his worth and credit 2655
       That's seal'd in approbation? You, Lord Escalus,
       Sit with my cousin; lend him your kind pains
       To find out this abuse, whence 'tis derived.
       There is another friar that set them on;
       Let him be sent for. 2660

     * Friar Peter. Would he were here, my lord! for he indeed
       Hath set the women on to this complaint:
       Your provost knows the place where he abides
       And he may fetch him.

     * Vincentio. Go do it instantly. 2665
       [Exit Provost]
       And you, my noble and well-warranted cousin,
       Whom it concerns to hear this matter forth,
       Do with your injuries as seems you best,
       In any chastisement: I for a while will leave you; 2670
       But stir not you till you have well determined
       Upon these slanderers.

     * Escalus. My lord, we'll do it throughly.
       [Exit DUKE]
       Signior Lucio, did not you say you knew that 2675
       Friar Lodowick to be a dishonest person?

     * Lucio. 'Cucullus non facit monachum:' honest in nothing
       but in his clothes; and one that hath spoke most
       villanous speeches of the duke.

     * Escalus. We shall entreat you to abide here till he come and 2680
       enforce them against him: we shall find this friar a
       notable fellow.

     * Lucio. As any in Vienna, on my word.

     * Escalus. Call that same Isabel here once again; I would speak with
       her.
       [Exit an Attendant] 2685
       Pray you, my lord, give me leave to question; you
       shall see how I'll handle her.

     * Lucio. Not better than he, by her own report.

     * Escalus. Say you?

     * Lucio. Marry, sir, I think, if you handled her privately, 2690
       she would sooner confess: perchance, publicly,
       she'll be ashamed.

     * Escalus. I will go darkly to work with her.

     * Lucio. That's the way; for women are light at midnight.
       [Re-enter Officers with ISABELLA; and Provost with] 2695
       the DUKE VINCENTIO in his friar's habit]

     * Escalus. Come on, mistress: here's a gentlewoman denies all
       that you have said.

     * Lucio. My lord, here comes the rascal I spoke of; here with
       the provost. 2700

     * Escalus. In very good time: speak not you to him till we
       call upon you.

     * Lucio. Mum.

     * Escalus. Come, sir: did you set these women on to slander
       Lord Angelo? they have confessed you did. 2705

     * Vincentio. 'Tis false.

     * Escalus. How! know you where you are?

     * Vincentio. Respect to your great place! and let the devil
       Be sometime honour'd for his burning throne!
       Where is the duke? 'tis he should hear me speak. 2710

     * Escalus. The duke's in us; and we will hear you speak:
       Look you speak justly.

     * Vincentio. Boldly, at least. But, O, poor souls,
       Come you to seek the lamb here of the fox?
       Good night to your redress! Is the duke gone? 2715
       Then is your cause gone too. The duke's unjust,
       Thus to retort your manifest appeal,
       And put your trial in the villain's mouth
       Which here you come to accuse.

     * Lucio. This is the rascal; this is he I spoke of. 2720

     * Escalus. Why, thou unreverend and unhallow'd friar,
       Is't not enough thou hast suborn'd these women
       To accuse this worthy man, but, in foul mouth
       And in the witness of his proper ear,
       To call him villain? and then to glance from him 2725
       To the duke himself, to tax him with injustice?
       Take him hence; to the rack with him! We'll touse you
       Joint by joint, but we will know his purpose.
       What 'unjust'!

     * Vincentio. Be not so hot; the duke 2730
       Dare no more stretch this finger of mine than he
       Dare rack his own: his subject am I not,
       Nor here provincial. My business in this state
       Made me a looker on here in Vienna,
       Where I have seen corruption boil and bubble 2735
       Till it o'er-run the stew; laws for all faults,
       But faults so countenanced, that the strong statutes
       Stand like the forfeits in a barber's shop,
       As much in mock as mark.

     * Escalus. Slander to the state! Away with him to prison! 2740

     * Angelo. What can you vouch against him, Signior Lucio?
       Is this the man that you did tell us of?

     * Lucio. 'Tis he, my lord. Come hither, goodman baldpate:
       do you know me?

     * Vincentio. I remember you, sir, by the sound of your voice: I 2745
       met you at the prison, in the absence of the duke.

     * Lucio. O, did you so? And do you remember what you said of the
       duke?

     * Vincentio. Most notedly, sir.

     * Lucio. Do you so, sir? And was the duke a fleshmonger, a
       fool, and a coward, as you then reported him to be? 2750

     * Vincentio. You must, sir, change persons with me, ere you make
       that my report: you, indeed, spoke so of him; and
       much more, much worse.

     * Lucio. O thou damnable fellow! Did not I pluck thee by the
       nose for thy speeches? 2755

     * Vincentio. I protest I love the duke as I love myself.

     * Angelo. Hark, how the villain would close now, after his
       treasonable abuses!

     * Escalus. Such a fellow is not to be talked withal. Away with
       him to prison! Where is the provost? Away with him 2760
       to prison! lay bolts enough upon him: let him
       speak no more. Away with those giglots too, and
       with the other confederate companion!

     * Vincentio. [To Provost] Stay, sir; stay awhile.

     * Angelo. What, resists he? Help him, Lucio. 2765

     * Lucio. Come, sir; come, sir; come, sir; foh, sir! Why, you
       bald-pated, lying rascal, you must be hooded, must
       you? Show your knave's visage, with a pox to you!
       show your sheep-biting face, and be hanged an hour!
       Will't not off? 2770

   [Pulls off the friar's hood, and discovers DUKE VINCENTIO]
     * Vincentio. Thou art the first knave that e'er madest a duke.
       First, provost, let me bail these gentle three.
       [To LUCIO]
       Sneak not away, sir; for the friar and you 2775
       Must have a word anon. Lay hold on him.

     * Lucio. This may prove worse than hanging.

     * Vincentio. [To ESCALUS] What you have spoke I pardon: sit you down:
       We'll borrow place of him.
       [To ANGELO] 2780
       Sir, by your leave.
       Hast thou or word, or wit, or impudence,
       That yet can do thee office? If thou hast,
       Rely upon it till my tale be heard,
       And hold no longer out. 2785

     * Angelo. O my dread lord,
       I should be guiltier than my guiltiness,
       To think I can be undiscernible,
       When I perceive your grace, like power divine,. Hath look'd upon my
       passes. Then, good prince,
       No longer session hold upon my shame, 2790
       But let my trial be mine own confession:
       Immediate sentence then and sequent death
       Is all the grace I beg.

     * Vincentio. Come hither, Mariana.
       Say, wast thou e'er contracted to this woman? 2795

     * Angelo. I was, my lord.

     * Vincentio. Go take her hence, and marry her instantly.
       Do you the office, friar; which consummate,
       Return him here again. Go with him, provost.

   [Exeunt ANGELO, MARIANA, FRIAR PETER and Provost]
     * Escalus. My lord, I am more amazed at his dishonour
       Than at the strangeness of it.

     * Vincentio. Come hither, Isabel.
       Your friar is now your prince: as I was then
       Advertising and holy to your business, 2805
       Not changing heart with habit, I am still
       Attorney'd at your service.

     * Isabella. O, give me pardon,
       That I, your vassal, have employ'd and pain'd
       Your unknown sovereignty! 2810

     * Vincentio. You are pardon'd, Isabel:
       And now, dear maid, be you as free to us.
       Your brother's death, I know, sits at your heart;
       And you may marvel why I obscured myself,
       Labouring to save his life, and would not rather 2815
       Make rash remonstrance of my hidden power
       Than let him so be lost. O most kind maid,
       It was the swift celerity of his death,
       Which I did think with slower foot came on,
       That brain'd my purpose. But, peace be with him! 2820
       That life is better life, past fearing death,
       Than that which lives to fear: make it your comfort,
       So happy is your brother.

     * Isabella. I do, my lord.

   [Re-enter ANGELO, MARIANA, FRIAR PETER, and Provost]
     * Vincentio. For this new-married man approaching here,
       Whose salt imagination yet hath wrong'd
       Your well defended honour, you must pardon
       For Mariana's sake: but as he adjudged your brother,—
       Being criminal, in double violation 2830
       Of sacred chastity and of promise-breach
       Thereon dependent, for your brother's life,—
       The very mercy of the law cries out
       Most audible, even from his proper tongue,
       'An Angelo for Claudio, death for death!' 2835
       Haste still pays haste, and leisure answers leisure;
       Like doth quit like, and MEASURE still FOR MEASURE.
       Then, Angelo, thy fault's thus manifested;
       Which, though thou wouldst deny, denies thee vantage.
       We do condemn thee to the very block 2840
       Where Claudio stoop'd to death, and with like haste.
       Away with him!

     * Mariana. O my most gracious lord,
       I hope you will not mock me with a husband.

     * Vincentio. It is your husband mock'd you with a husband. 2845
       Consenting to the safeguard of your honour,
       I thought your marriage fit; else imputation,
       For that he knew you, might reproach your life
       And choke your good to come; for his possessions,
       Although by confiscation they are ours, 2850
       We do instate and widow you withal,
       To buy you a better husband.

     * Mariana. O my dear lord,
       I crave no other, nor no better man.

     * Vincentio. Never crave him; we are definitive. 2855

     * Mariana. Gentle my liege,—

   [Kneeling]
     * Vincentio. You do but lose your labour.
       Away with him to death!
       [To LUCIO] 2860
       Now, sir, to you.

     * Mariana. O my good lord! Sweet Isabel, take my part;
       Lend me your knees, and all my life to come
       I'll lend you all my life to do you service.

     * Vincentio. Against all sense you do importune her: 2865
       Should she kneel down in mercy of this fact,
       Her brother's ghost his paved bed would break,
       And take her hence in horror.

     * Mariana. Isabel,
       Sweet Isabel, do yet but kneel by me; 2870
       Hold up your hands, say nothing; I'll speak all.
       They say, best men are moulded out of faults;
       And, for the most, become much more the better
       For being a little bad: so may my husband.
       O Isabel, will you not lend a knee? 2875

     * Vincentio. He dies for Claudio's death.

     * Isabella. Most bounteous sir,
       [Kneeling]
       Look, if it please you, on this man condemn'd,
       As if my brother lived: I partly think 2880
       A due sincerity govern'd his deeds,
       Till he did look on me: since it is so,
       Let him not die. My brother had but justice,
       In that he did the thing for which he died:
       For Angelo, 2885
       His act did not o'ertake his bad intent,
       And must be buried but as an intent
       That perish'd by the way: thoughts are no subjects;
       Intents but merely thoughts.

     * Mariana. Merely, my lord. 2890

     * Vincentio. Your suit's unprofitable; stand up, I say.
       I have bethought me of another fault.
       Provost, how came it Claudio was beheaded
       At an unusual hour?

     * Provost. It was commanded so. 2895

     * Vincentio. Had you a special warrant for the deed?

     * Provost. No, my good lord; it was by private message.

     * Vincentio. For which I do discharge you of your office:
       Give up your keys.

     * Provost. Pardon me, noble lord: 2900
       I thought it was a fault, but knew it not;
       Yet did repent me, after more advice;
       For testimony whereof, one in the prison,
       That should by private order else have died,
       I have reserved alive. 2905

     * Vincentio. What's he?

     * Provost. His name is Barnardine.

     * Vincentio. I would thou hadst done so by Claudio.
       Go fetch him hither; let me look upon him.

   [Exit Provost]
     * Escalus. I am sorry, one so learned and so wise
       As you, Lord Angelo, have still appear'd,
       Should slip so grossly, both in the heat of blood.
       And lack of temper'd judgment afterward.

     * Angelo. I am sorry that such sorrow I procure: 2915
       And so deep sticks it in my penitent heart
       That I crave death more willingly than mercy;
       'Tis my deserving, and I do entreat it.
       [Re-enter Provost, with BARNARDINE, CLAUDIO muffled,]
       and JULIET] 2920

     * Vincentio. Which is that Barnardine?

     * Provost. This, my lord.

     * Vincentio. There was a friar told me of this man.
       Sirrah, thou art said to have a stubborn soul.
       That apprehends no further than this world, 2925
       And squarest thy life according. Thou'rt condemn'd:
       But, for those earthly faults, I quit them all;
       And pray thee take this mercy to provide
       For better times to come. Friar, advise him;
       I leave him to your hand. What muffled fellow's that? 2930

     * Provost. This is another prisoner that I saved.
       Who should have died when Claudio lost his head;
       As like almost to Claudio as himself.

   [Unmuffles CLAUDIO]
     * Vincentio. [To ISABELLA] If he be like your brother, for his sake
       2935
       Is he pardon'd; and, for your lovely sake,
       Give me your hand and say you will be mine.
       He is my brother too: but fitter time for that.
       By this Lord Angelo perceives he's safe;
       Methinks I see a quickening in his eye. 2940
       Well, Angelo, your evil quits you well:
       Look that you love your wife; her worth worth yours.
       I find an apt remission in myself;
       And yet here's one in place I cannot pardon.
       [To LUCIO] 2945
       You, sirrah, that knew me for a fool, a coward,
       One all of luxury, an ass, a madman;
       Wherein have I so deserved of you,
       That you extol me thus?

     * Lucio. 'Faith, my lord. I spoke it but according to the 2950
       trick. If you will hang me for it, you may; but I
       had rather it would please you I might be whipt.

     * Vincentio. Whipt first, sir, and hanged after.
       Proclaim it, provost, round about the city.
       Is any woman wrong'd by this lewd fellow, 2955
       As I have heard him swear himself there's one
       Whom he begot with child, let her appear,
       And he shall marry her: the nuptial finish'd,
       Let him be whipt and hang'd.

     * Lucio. I beseech your highness, do not marry me to a whore. 2960
       Your highness said even now, I made you a duke:
       good my lord, do not recompense me in making me a cuckold.

     * Vincentio. Upon mine honour, thou shalt marry her.
       Thy slanders I forgive; and therewithal
       Remit thy other forfeits. Take him to prison; 2965
       And see our pleasure herein executed.

     * Lucio. Marrying a punk, my lord, is pressing to death,
       whipping, and hanging.

     * Vincentio. Slandering a prince deserves it.
       [Exit Officers with LUCIO] 2970
       She, Claudio, that you wrong'd, look you restore.
       Joy to you, Mariana! Love her, Angelo:
       I have confess'd her and I know her virtue.
       Thanks, good friend Escalus, for thy much goodness:
       There's more behind that is more gratulate. 2975
       Thanks, provost, for thy care and secrecy:
       We shill employ thee in a worthier place.
       Forgive him, Angelo, that brought you home
       The head of Ragozine for Claudio's:
       The offence pardons itself. Dear Isabel, 2980
       I have a motion much imports your good;
       Whereto if you'll a willing ear incline,
       What's mine is yours and what is yours is mine.
       So, bring us to our palace; where we'll show
       What's yet behind, that's meet you all should know. 2985
