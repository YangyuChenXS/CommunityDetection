                                 SONNET CVI

                    When in the chronicle of wasted time
                  I see descriptions of the fairest wights,
                    And beauty making beautiful old rhyme
                In praise of ladies dead and lovely knights,
                Then, in the blazon of sweet beauty's best, 5
                 Of hand, of foot, of lip, of eye, of brow,
                I see their antique pen would have express'd
                    Even such a beauty as you master now.
                   So all their praises are but prophecies
                  Of this our time, all you prefiguring; 10
                And, for they look'd but with divining eyes,
                They had not skill enough your worth to sing:
                  For we, which now behold these present days,
               Had eyes to wonder, but lack tongues to praise. 14
