                 My mistress' eyes are nothing like the sun;
                  Coral is far more red than her lips' red;
               If snow be white, why then her breasts are dun;
              If hairs be wires, black wires grow on her head.
                I have seen roses damask'd, red and white, 5
                   But no such roses see I in her cheeks;
                 And in some perfumes is there more delight
               Than in the breath that from my mistress reeks.
                  I love to hear her speak, yet well I know
                That music hath a far more pleasing sound; 10
                      I grant I never saw a goddess go;
             My mistress, when she walks, treads on the ground:
                   And yet, by heaven, I think my love as rare
                    As any she belied with false compare. 14
