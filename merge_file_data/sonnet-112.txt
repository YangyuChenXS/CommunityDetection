                                 SONNET CXII

                 Your love and pity doth the impression fill
                 Which vulgar scandal stamp'd upon my brow;
                  For what care I who calls me well or ill,
                  So you o'er-green my bad, my good allow?
                You are my all the world, and I must strive 5
               To know my shames and praises from your tongue:
                    None else to me, nor I to none alive,
              That my steel'd sense or changes right or wrong.
                    In so profound abysm I throw all care
                 Of others' voices, that my adder's sense 10
                   To critic and to flatterer stopped are.
                   Mark how with my neglect I do dispense:
                     You are so strongly in my purpose bred
                That all the world besides methinks are dead. 14
