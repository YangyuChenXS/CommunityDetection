                                 SONNET CXIV

              Or whether doth my mind, being crown'd with you,
                Drink up the monarch's plague, this flattery?
                Or whether shall I say, mine eye saith true,
                 And that your love taught it this alchemy,
                  To make of monsters and things indigest 5
                 Such cherubins as your sweet self resemble,
                     Creating every bad a perfect best,
                  As fast as objects to his beams assemble?
                O,'tis the first; 'tis flattery in my seeing,
               And my great mind most kingly drinks it up: 10
             Mine eye well knows what with his gust is 'greeing,
                   And to his palate doth prepare the cup:
                     If it be poison'd, 'tis the lesser sin
                 That mine eye loves it and doth first begin. 14

                                      O
