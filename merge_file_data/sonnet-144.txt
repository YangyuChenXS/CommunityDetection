                                SONNET CXLIV

                  Two loves I have of comfort and despair,
                 Which like two spirits do suggest me still:
                    The better angel is a man right fair,
                   The worser spirit a woman colour'd ill.
                  To win me soon to hell, my female evil 5
                   Tempteth my better angel from my side,
                  And would corrupt my saint to be a devil,
                   Wooing his purity with her foul pride.
                  And whether that my angel be turn'd fiend
                  Suspect I may, but not directly tell; 10
                But being both from me, both to each friend,
                    I guess one angel in another's hell:
                 Yet this shall I ne'er know, but live in doubt,
                   Till my bad angel fire my good one out. 14
