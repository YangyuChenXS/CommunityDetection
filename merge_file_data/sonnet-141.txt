                                 SONNET CXLI

                In faith, I do not love thee with mine eyes,
                  For they in thee a thousand errors note;
               But 'tis my heart that loves what they despise,
                 Who in despite of view is pleased to dote;
            Nor are mine ears with thy tongue's tune delighted, 5
                 Nor tender feeling, to base touches prone,
                 Nor taste, nor smell, desire to be invited
                    To any sensual feast with thee alone:
                   But my five wits nor my five senses can
              Dissuade one foolish heart from serving thee, 10
                 Who leaves unsway'd the likeness of a man,
               Thy proud hearts slave and vassal wretch to be:
                    Only my plague thus far I count my gain,
                  That she that makes me sin awards me pain. 14
