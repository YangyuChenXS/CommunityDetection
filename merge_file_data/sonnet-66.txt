                                 SONNET LXVI

               Tired with all these, for restful death I cry,
                     As, to behold desert a beggar born,
                    And needy nothing trimm'd in jollity,
                    And purest faith unhappily forsworn,
                 And guilded honour shamefully misplaced, 5
                    And maiden virtue rudely strumpeted,
                 And right perfection wrongfully disgraced,
                   And strength by limping sway disabled,
                   And art made tongue-tied by authority,
                 And folly doctor-like controlling skill, 10
                   And simple truth miscall'd simplicity,
                   And captive good attending captain ill:
                Tired with all these, from these would I be gone,
                  Save that, to die, I leave my love alone. 14
