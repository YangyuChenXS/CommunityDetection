                                 SONNET XLII

                 That thou hast her, it is not all my grief,
                 And yet it may be said I loved her dearly;
                 That she hath thee, is of my wailing chief,
                 A loss in love that touches me more nearly.
                 Loving offenders, thus I will excuse ye: 5
             Thou dost love her, because thou knowst I love her;
                 And for my sake even so doth she abuse me,
               Suffering my friend for my sake to approve her.
                 If I lose thee, my loss is my love's gain,
             And losing her, my friend hath found that loss; 10
                Both find each other, and I lose both twain,
                 And both for my sake lay on me this cross:
                  But here's the joy; my friend and I are one;
                 Sweet flattery! then she loves but me alone. 14
